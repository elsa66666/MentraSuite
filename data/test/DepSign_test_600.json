        "query": "I'm sad : It's kinda always been an issue. I wouldn't say it's as bad as my peers but it's definitely bad. There's a lot that I obviously can't write cause it would take a while but I'll just say the grand scheme of things. So basically I'm not really happy. I haven't been happy. It definitely started to get really bad last year but it was always an issue growing up. I was very emotional growing up and by the time I was in 4th or 5th grade I had self esteem issues. There wasn't much of a reason why, I just did. I didn't like myself. Tbh I hated almost everything about myself until like middle of 7th/8th grade. I found a group of friends that I would hang out with everyday and everything felt authentic. Like we always said shit how it was and got along great. We did lie about something or start some shit with each over someone else. Like we just stuck by each other. It's hard to explain. But they all stopped talking to me. First, one of them ended up stopping talking to me because my friend. Then the other friend just stopped wanting to hang out. It wasn't that he wasn't friends with us anymore, he just stayed inside all day. So it was just me and the other friend and he prioritizes school over a lot of things so basically I was alone. Like yeah I could text people but it's not really enough. It's not very easy for my to make new friends. I'm an introvert and honestly I'm just awkward if I don't know you. This all happened in 10th grade. 11th grade was by far my worst year. My grandfather passed away. He was more of a father to me, as my dad wasn't really in my life for the first 10 years. I found a girlfriend and she cheated on me. My grades were slacking causing more stress. I was alone. I had 1 close friend. There was a lot of times where I honestly wanted to kill myself. I found another girlfriend. Shes been great. We're very close. But I still feel depressed. I'm in my senior year now. \nThe whole reason why I started feeling this way was after February break. I had a lot of time to myself and I was able to reflect. A lot of the nights I smoked weed just so I didn't have to think because I knew it wasn't going to be well. Every vacation, whether summer, Holliday, April, February, whatever, I get really sad. I don't smoke when I have school or if I have to do something in the morning cause the mornings are hell. So I was thinking. I realized I'm very dependent on people. I need social interaction in real life to stay happy. The issue is I'm not able to get it. Even when I do, I'm sometimes still not happy. I just don't know what to do. About a month ago, me and my gf broke up. She wasn't happy. I was obviously sad about it, but I was finally gonna get help for everything because as bad as it sounds, I know I need her. Without her, I genuinely don't think I can live. She's pretty much all I have at this point I feel like. I would never tell her this, as I don't want her to feel trapped. \nI don't know what to do. I can't really bring myself to tell my mom about it. My sister was suicidal and it hurt my whole family. I just don't want her to feel bad. I don't want to be put on meds or something either, but I just don't know what to do. I stayed home from school yesterday and I want to again. I have no motivation. There's a lot more to it I just kinda wrote this up in a couple minutes. I probably forgot some important stuff but the main issue is really this paragraph. I know I have some issue. I just don't know how to fix it, well more so I can't bring myself to tell anyone.",

After going to college, I became an atheist - and my family basically stopped really caring what happened in my life and who I was. To make matters worse, I was always so religiously sheltered growing up that I never really made many (if any) close friends. \nWell, a lot of things in life wound up with me moving to Colorado a few years back. I met a girl I really liked. She had dogs and lived with her family. She invited me to move in with them, so I did and paid her parents each week. They talked me into getting a dog, which I did about 6 months in to the relationship. I fell completely in love with the dog (Mira) and the family. \nWell, about 2.5 years into the relationship, she broke up with me (really, out of nowhere. I thought we were happy). At the same time, a seasonal job I had was just ending. Also, they were my home. So, I found myself with no friends, no adopted family, no job, no girlfriend... everything was gone. But, at least I had my dog. \nI tried to make things work, somehow, for about 3 months. But... my dog is really nervous and I can't take her to dog day cares. I also can't afford dog walkers for her, let alone even afford my own place that allows dogs. But I'm also extremely guilty when leaving her along 10+ hours each day for work... like it kills me. She is a lab, and is very attached and used to having many dogs, a backyard with a dog door, family coming and going... the works. I could tell that with me she was very depressed. \nSo I moved to Ohio, where things are a little cheaper, so maybe I might make things work. As soon as I got back with Mira, I came to the realization that my family was unwilling to help me or my dog. I didn't have a place to stay, and I didn't have a job so I had no way of finding housing. I was living in my car with the dog. After a few weeks of this I had to give up. I couldn't just give my dog to a shelter, so I drove all the way back to Colorado to drop her off with my exes family in secret... and they told me they were going to get rid of her if I didn't come back to get her. \nI came back to Ohio without Mira... and have been realizing there is just nothing here for me. I have a family that just doesn't care about me, and no job prospects in my field (outdoor recreation). My friends have all moved on from when I was last in Ohio... nobody is reaching out or attempting to see me. I feel so absolutely alone, and now... now I don't have my dog, even. I reached out to my family that I was feeling extremely depressed/maybe suicidal for help.. and they told me that they didn't want me around because I was \"scaring them\". That hurt so amazingly bad.\nSo, I am feeling extremely alone and depressed right now. I don't really know what the right thing to do is - when I have my dog, I feel so overwhelmed/guilty leaving her, but I can't really take her to day cares. But without her, I feel - truly/stunningly alone. And if I don't go back to Colorado soon and get her... I will lose her forever.\nI feel extremely depressed, but I don't see a solution or a way out of this. Does anyone have any kind of ideas for me? I need help so badly right now.",

It sure doesn't feel like it. : It feels like there's no comfort or help anywhere for the pain and stress that have become constants in my life and driven me near the edge. Lately I've been hit with a deluge of, to put it mildly, unpleasant life events, and I'm left wondering how much more I can be expected to take. \nI try to find some comfort in cultivating a balanced life, but nothing seems to help. Either that, or I stumble across something that makes everything worse. A nice evening with friends leads me right back to the crushing death-spiral of depression as soon as I arrive back home to my empty flat. My work, which used to bring me pleasure or at least some measure of purpose, now feels like an insurmountable obstacle that I often can't even bring myself to face until the last minute (in some case, after the last minute). My most recent romantic dalliance since my unwanted divorce, in which he offered me flowery promises of love and a life together, ended in heartbreak before it truly began. Therapy is a temporary bandaid that prematurely gets ripped off between appointments, leaving me picking at the scabs until next time. And inpatient treatment? So I can be subjected to some superficial group therapy meetings at best and doped up on antipsychotics at worst, all while being treated as a prisoner? Forget it. So where can I realistically turn? It's a total cliche to say \"No one gets it,\" but it's true. No one who hasn't felt this way gets it. They can sympathize and try their best to understand the pain and the helplessness, but it's not something they can truly grasp.\nI'm not particularly religious. In my mind as well as my heart I simply can't believe in God or an afterlife since it just doesn't make sense to me. I dearly wish I could because the people I know who do  so seem so happy, fulfilled, and hopeful. I do, however, try to find some small comfort in the rituals and prayers I grew up with, and I can't stop myself from crying out to the universe or some God to deliver me from this hell in which I've found myself. Not necessarily through death, but something has to give. Coupled with the constant, overbearing weight of depression, this onslaught of pain has just become entirely too much to bear. They say real help comes from within, but what if there's nothing inside? I have nothing to give, to myself or to this world. So what can I even do? If it truly all comes down to me, I'm doomed.",

I have played the scene in the back of my mind for so many times that I know exactly how much second it would take, the leaves I will be touching on my way down or the exact set of stones I would have my head banged against. It was also then I almost gave the idea of finding a person who would trust me with all their self and confide in me their truest and purest version. \nBut it happened I did find love and I did find a person who loved me all their heart. At this time, those years, I felt less suicidal than ever. It was an era of dreams, having passions. But, even it wasnt as crystal perfect as it sounds, nothing is. I somehow knew that even this would end, I cant be that lucky. And end it did after exactly 3 summers. I again became back to having suicidal thoughts, this time it was mostly dreams of being drowned in lakes, oceans, anywhere with water.\nIt took a month I again fell in love and this person knew whatever I was going through better than anyone and stayed so for the next three winters. I had suicidal thoughts here and there but the person was really nice to many and kept care of my dark days. Even with this I knew at the back of my head that this could end as I kept breaking her spirit unciouscly, now that today she is gone I have no more reason to live, no more reasons to evade suicidal thoughts. This time I have medicines and repallants in mind, but whats different this time is that this time I dont have any hope for tomorrow any inhibitions that have otherwise kept me from taking this step.

        "query": "I hope I can post this here. My wife has severe depression. And it's effecting both of our lives very heavily. What can I do to help? : So. Let me just say I've been around this my whole life. My mother had severe depression. And other mental health issues. I also developed a little bit of depression in my high school years. Which was due to my father and stepmother who were drug addicted narcissist. Since graduating and moving away I've been so positive and had a great look on life. \nBut .. my wife has got it and she's got it bad. We met when we were both depressed in high school about our family situations. So when we graduated. We jumped in my car and left. Moved 500+ miles away. Lived with family and were having much more fun. She was still slightly depressed then. But she was a lot happier. \nThe turning point was when we got pregnant with our daughter. We both always wanted kids. We wanted the family life so we could have our own family and raise our kids better than our parents did us. But.. that all changed when it actually happened. My wife begged to have a baby young. I was a little reluctant because I knew the price that's paid. I grew up raising my siblings (think Fiona in shameless). I knew what it was like to care for others every single need. And I warned her of this. But of course I wanted a family too. So we agreed and it happened. \nThat's when everything went South. Litterally. We moved back south near her family. And had our daughter. The entire pregnancy was a depressed nightmare for my wife. She was stuck home while I worked full time. And she resented me for it. I even changed jobs to try and work night shift so I was home during the day and she had the 1 car we had. That didn't work. She would keep me up all day and not let me sleep. I was running on 4 hours of sleep a day. For MONTHS. Then our daughter was born and she was overwhelmed. She never experienced adult life and instead of taking it head on. She shied away. And relied heavily on me to take care of all the \"adult\" stuff. I worked, cooked, cleaned, made Dr appts, went to Dr appts, came home early from work if there was any issues. I had to stop suicide attempts multiple times. Ive had to fight knives away from her multiple times. \nI ended up losing my job that year because of it. After that we bounced around job to job. House to house. Like crazy. \nAnd now. We're restarting all over again. We found a very cheap house to rent. I'm at a new job. Things have finally settled down again since our daughter was born. But. The depression is still there. She's better in the sense that she's better at talking to people. She's not so afraid to make phone calls anymore. And go to the doctor alone. She's still afraid to drive long distances though. And she still has no friends. So she sits at home while I work. And she just gets depressed over and over again every single day. Then when I get home I have to scramble to pick up the pieces. \nIf you step back and look at our life. We should be HAPPY. We have a place. A beautiful daughter. A dog. 2 cars now! There's food, tv, Netflix. We have a yard. We live close by to some good shopping and parks. We are doing GREAT for a couple 20 year olds. \nBut she doesn't see it. She sees all her old friends on Instagram and Facebook living the college life. Having fun still like in high school. And she gets hateful of her own life and her own circumstances. She wants friends, And money, and a job. But she doesnt have any of those. And she gets super depressed about it. And she turns that anger towards me when I'm home. And takes out her anger on me like it's my fault. Saying if she never met me she'd be happy and be having fun. \nI told her. She has her own car now. PLEASE go out and do SOMETHING during the day to keep her mind out of the gutters. Go out and meet people! Go see an old friend! Do SOMETHING. But all she has for me are excuses. Of why she can't or how she's afraid to. \nI just want to figure out how to help her. She refused medication. She doesn't like it. Also she's horrible at remembering to take it. \nWhat can I do? Cause we should be enjoying life right now. But instead it's like I have the whole world on my shoulders. And she's just trying to jump out the window of a moving train on a daily basis. \nWhat can I do for her? Please. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading",

It is important to mention at this time I had an emotional affair with a co worker which I now regret to the fullest extent and honestly might be a big part of why my depression is getting so bad. I never said I was a saint in life. Had to start all over so naturally bills started piling up. That was when we found out we were having a baby. In all the excitement it let me forget about everything that was slowly turning upside down in my life. A year and a half later my oldest sister gave me the Christmas gift of paying a retainer for a lawyer so me and my wife could file bankruptcy and start over. Things were good again I was back in a management position at a large retailer again making ok money. Then after the bankruptcy I was told to step down due to performance at work so my income went down again but this time I got a second job. Never saw my family much but I was paying the bills so to me it felt alright. But then I got involved in a child custody case with my ex due to her drug use and disappearing on the kids for a week while they were her ex's mother. That lasted about five months and ended up losing the case mostly due to me living so far away and that I hadn't seen my kids that much since I had left even though I kept strong communication with them. So I lost. All through the he court process I lost an uncle to cancer and also found out my estranged father was dying. I hadn't talked to because I shut him out of my life with no real reason besides that my mom really was bothered by him and me having any kind of relationship. Things started looking up when I got another chance to move up at work but that ultimately didn't work out and I've had to step down once again. Now we're struggling financially and emotionally and I feel like I am to blame for everything because I am. It's my fault that we're in this mess again, it's my fault we're getting behind on bills again, I constantly fight with my wife and they always consist of her saying she wants a divorce because she's miserable. I don't know what to do. I'm toxic to everyone around me and I mess up everything. I'm a failure in everything I do. I destroy everything I'm apart of. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I sometimes wish that I would just have an accident or something so I don't have to keep letting everyone I love down and driving my wife who I love so so much away. I don't do anything I only leave the house for work and that's it. I'm a type 1 diabetic and I haven't seen a doctor in almost two years.

I have lost confidence in speaking and feel embarrassed to talk to someone new... What is the problem with my voice?",

        "query": "my entire life is crumbling apart : this is a long post, with a shit ton of back story and references to trauma, abuse, infidelity, substance abuse, suicide. \nMy life has steadily been collapsing since I met my abuser in 2013. I stayed with him for three years, through severe financial, sexual, mental, and physical abuse. He just absolutely destroyed my ability to trust, my sense of safety, and devastated my relationships with my friends and family by isolating me and disrespecting them. When I left in 2016, I petitioned for and was granted a protective order for the maximum term allowed by law - 3 years. I've had vivid night terrors since I left that typically involve my abuser getting into my home, or slaughtering someone I love. I started seeing a therapist and was diagnosed with C-PTSD, MDD, and Panic Disorder. \nIn end of 2017, I began dating a guy we'll call Sam. Sam seemed super kind, caring, just an overall great person. We'd known each other since 2011, but our relationship still felt new and exciting!  \nUnfortunately, I found out in October that Sam had cheated on me several times over the \\~2 years we'd dated by then. He slept with someone else several times, had nudes of another woman, and emotionally cheated with a third that we'll call Sarah. \nSam would text Sarah every day all day. He'd ask her to dinner, take her to coffee, he took her to a wedding. Drove her everywhere. Introduced her to his son, even. Constantly complimented her body, and would refer to her as \"Pretty girl\" every day. I was upset about the woman he'd slept with, but his relationship with Sarah was devastating. \nHe promised not to see her or talk to her anymore, but I found out through mutual friends that they were still hanging out. She and I ended up in a confrontation over text, in which she said very hateful things about my relationship, which felt like she'd heard from Sam. She continually messaged me dogging on me and my relationship until I blocked her shortly after xmas. Things were okay for a few weeks.\nFast forward to end of January. One of my very close friends committed suicide. This was overwhelming, especially because he'd reached out to me two days before it happened, and I told him I was too depressed to really talk. \nWhen I went home for the funeral, I stayed with Sam. He received emails from Sarah that someone was harassing her online, and she believed it was me. It culminated on the day of my friend's funeral that Sarah showed up to Sam's with her father (no we are not teenagers, she is 35 and lives with her parents). She demanded that I speak to her, yelled at me, called me obscene names, and begged me to \"hit her so she could have my ass thrown in jail\". I was already drunk on two bottles of wine, and in NO state to handle anything, so I just kept repeating that she needed to leave and I had no interest in talking to her. \nSam took her side and told her she didnt have to leave. She then asked me if \"we we're even dating.\" When i said we had been for two years, she freaked out on Sam. Apparently, he'd told her that I was a stalker, he didnt really know me, and I was only at his house because he was afraid Id kill myself. She left after blowing up on him, and he just went back to working on his computer in the next room. Part of me feels like HE is the one that messaged her online and created the entire blowup. \nI was absolutely devastated. My friend's suicide, my relationship with Sam, Sarah's outbursts. It was too much. I took a box cutter off the shelf and sliced open my arm, then downed the rest of my citalopram. (6 pills of 40 MG)\nSince that night, I've (halfway) broken things off with Sam. Even though we still talk and hang out and everything. i feel like im just stuck in another cycle and im ashamed and just feel pathetic for allowing him to stick around. I drink 1-2 bottles of wine or most of a bottle of vodka each night. I dont eat. I still cant sleep because of night terrors. I cant afford therapy anymore so I just switched my meds to see if that helps. My entire life feels pointless and painful and I'm honestly just exhausted by everything. I have no idea how to move forward or if I even want to. Idk. I don't really even know if I want advice or to just be able to admit that I want to die without being locked away in a hospital and losing my job while still feeling fucking awful.",

My family is in the middle class, so I've always had a comfortable life. I've always gotten good grades at school, though I had to skip 1st and 2nd grade due to certain circumstances. Currently in high school, with my favorite areas of study being math. I was involved in combat sports, which I enjoyed and participated in competitions. I started playing piano about 6 years ago, though I've quit a lot along the way and I haven't made much progress. I also enjoyed singing, though I never had a coach.\nSo, probably seems like a pretty perfect life? Happy family, only child, a model student, etc. Yeah, I try to think so too. But I feel weird, I feel as if I'm not good at anything. I am stupid, ugly, untalented, mediocre, etc. I hate myself. I hate my looks. I try to continue my old hobbies, but I feel that I'm never going to be great. I want to do math as a career but I'm demolished by my own thoughts that state that I'll never be remembered and that I'll live my life in vain. I've looked at high places and wondered what would happen if I was gone, if anybody would care or notice. I've come close to s*** h***. I was thinking of doing pro sports, but then I remembered that there are so many people who are younger than me and are more set to get Olympic goal than I'll ever be. I want to sing, play the piano, make music for many to hear,but then I hear my voice and that idea goes down the drain. I feel like because I'm the only child that ill disappoint my parents. I don't know what to think or how to describe it, but that's my attempt. I hope you guys will understand. Thank you, and I guess goodbye.",

For me, it's the direct opposite; I have a limited amount of friends (or acquaintances more likely), I don't feel happy most of the time and have 0 charisma. Granted, I'm watching videos on how to gain charisma and be more likeable but the progress of it is very gradual. And added with my family and the dynamics of it being fucked up, slogging through college for a degree that I both don't want and not good at (even if I eventually cared about it) and not feeling happy, I shouldn't be here.

I will be out of fellowship next month and it's still a year before I finish my PhD. I have been suicidal in my school days, tried once but no one knows.\nI have these thoughts again and again when I see my future going no where. I have a huge stage phobia of addressing any gathering or even having anyone's attention on me. This thing is hurting me most as in my PhD and in future I have to address audience (students) as I want to be a professor and I really enjoy explaining things to other but only one on one or to a small familiar non judgemental audience. Everytime before my half early PhD presentation I get in to a depressed stage and I feel like I run somewhere and be in isolation. \nBefore my first PhD presentation I was under huge mental stress and it got me diabetes insipidus (I think it was due to stress). I do not like sharing these thoughts with anyone and it's the first time I am sharing it to anyone. I think sharing this will not help me and people will just pretend they care but no one actually cares. I think I don't have the capability to survive financially or emotionally. I like being alone, living alone.\nOn personal front I have a girlfriend and our marriage is fixed later in this year. We have been together since 10+ years but I feel I am ruining her life too. She is very confident, well spoken in front of anyone but she is stuck with me.\nThe reason why I don't share these thoughts is because I have done nothing to solve these issue. I am a lazy person and just want to lay in bed surfing net playing games. I know I can be better but I don't make any effort. Also I am not brave enough for a suicide and I just wish someday I vanish from this world or better vanish from everyone's life like I never existed.",

I was happy with all of this and it is the same reason I developed a sick mindset that \"If someone passes you, you're not good enough\" and through out elementary, I never got to enjoy playing around with other kids. I was always \"focused\" on studies and because I was a loner I became anti-social. I hated people, despised others, always have frown on my face and its just shit. \nWhen I went to 1st year of Highschool (Grade 7 here in asia) I was a bookworm, a very agressive person. But it changed when I converted to Islam (not gonna get into that but yeah, Im the only muslim in my family). It was going good, until my family started questioning me about my belief and scaring me that Muslims are terrorist (hahaha If I was a terrorist, I would have left a long time ago). Eventually it set off a chain of events that haunts me everyday because of this I left home, I skipped school because of all this drama. I guess Im heartless now, Im scared to open up to people around me. Im distant with everyone in my family, I dont care as much with my school. It's the memories, always stuck in my head.

I'm not an especially good or talented automaton, but people that I think I care about continue to remain in my life so I must be doing reasonably okay. I can't describe it super well but I feel like my personality is a shell and I just react to stimulus like an insect would if it were met with a predator or obstacle. There doesn't seem to be any inner thought process going on that I can identify when I interact with other people. Whatever part of my brain that takes control when I'm placed in a situation where I have to socialize seems to do an okay job, as I can usually maintain small talk and make the right facial gestures and whatnot.

I don't know what that is. \nI've been diagnosed with ADHD by my doctor and I take a stimulant medication for it, and it helps, but even the ability to maintain focus doesn't seem to help me gather how I feel on a day to day basis and form a general consensus type thing about what is wrong with me. \nDoes anybody else have a similar experience?\nTldr I am an empty person, how I feel at any given moment is alien and foreign to me",

The world goes around as normal we are led to believe. \nBut in my case, there's been one thing that has completely changed, since my life started to go wrong. It's how people respond to me now that I'm lost and depressed as opposed to vibrant and well put together.\nI have a high education and have been working for years in my field. It has always given me a sense of stability to have my wits acknowledged and to able to connect to people easily and find the good in things. I lived in a fancy apartment in a very good neighbourhood. If I had to make a phone call to someone about something back then, it'd be with enthusiasm and about some minor detail, like arranging a birthday party or getting a vaccine for my kid etc. Every communication that I had with people was pleasant or non dramatic. I didn't have a reason to contact anyone to solve my problems. \nWell, the relationship fell apart. I'm the one who had to move out. I never found a place to rent or buy after that. It's been 5 years now. I've been renting many places for short periods, as this has been all I've able to find. My mental health has been going downwards for every year that has passed me by, without a place to call my own. I've had to call everyone and everything to fix my problems ever since. It's been one thing after the other, because of the domino effect. I *can't* find a place, so that adds major stress, I have to store all my stuff with family and with storage services, find a place to keep my address, figure out how to deal with that in conjuction to the fact that I have a kid with my ex and I can't just move my address far away without getting into trouble over it. I'm just floating around out here, like a balloon. I wonder when I'll completely float away. Life took a turn and *everything* changed. It's a nightmare and I'm performing miracles everyday just to make it into the next day, but the problems keep piling up and the people, the way they respond to me now.. \nI've found that *everybody* in my social circle is either a stranger now or apathetic towards my situation. I have no adults to lean on and everybody puts this extra distance or contempt towards me. I've had no help. I've really discovered society as a cold place that has just laughed in my face when I needed it the most. I feel used by society and thrown away like garbage. Every time that I've had to explain my ordeal to the municipality office or a doctor etc., they've talked to me like I'm stupid after learning that I'm stressed and depressed. It somehow takes away my credibility as a person that I've become depressed. Everyone speaks to me in a baby voice and I just almost reject the world for what it has become to me. Now I'm just shattered into bits and pieces mentally and can't even find a beginning or an end to this mess. It certainly feels like the dark night of the soul, but more than that it feels like the world changed when I changed.",

        "query": "I need to let out my feelings : On GCSE results day in 2018 I was kicked out of my school due to not meeting the high grade requirements. I think I always subconsiously knew I was never going to make the grades and stay there and I think thats where my depressed thoughts began. A few of my friends also got kicked out of that school and all went to a different one (the same one as each other). I, however, was forced by my parents to go to a different school, where I knew nobody and had to do A-levels that I didnt want to do in the first place. I dont blame my parents as they were trying to get me the best opportunity. But me being already quite nervous in social situations, struggled to make friends in the first couple of weeks. This huge knock in confidence has caused me to become even more nervous, and I have developed a nervous tick where I bite the insides of my cheeks. Im currently in my final year of school, where i sit alone and have done for almost 2 years. Last year i used to go on walks on my own during frees and lunch, to spare the embarrassment of being alone all of the time, however i have stopped caring and instead i just sit on my own. My grades are very bad as well, i can never be bothered to do any of my work, even when deadlines are approaching fast. I have even recently started to self harm, where i punch myself in the leg as hard as i can. Although i havent done this in a few months now, im not opposed to doing it again. Despite my bottled up problems, i am still very greatful for my friends who i see once a week at football but talk to online often. I am also greatful for my loving family. If it wasnt for my friends and family I think i may have taken my own life by now. \nFor anyone that read this passage thank you, i just needed to get it off my chest. X",

        "query": "Senior Year Sucks : Sorry for the long post. I graduate in 3 months and I am anxious. My high school \"experience\" has been pretty crappy. I play football and I wrestle. Or used to I guess. Going into my senior year I thought it would be the best year by far especially because junior year was so rough, I went through allot of anxiety and depression that year. \nThe start of summer made me think that everything was uphill from there and I had started my first job at Walmart and my supervisors all talked to my mom about how I was one of the best workers they've had in a while (my mom works there too) and football camp was great, I thought I had a chance to at the very least start on special teams (It was only my second year). I was talking to allot of people and hung out with my friends almost daily. I was doing pretty good. \nThen one day I was driving to work in my grandpa's truck when I got in a car accident. The worst part is how it happened. No rain or wet roads, No fog, No animals in the road, No other cars on the road, literally the most ideal driving conditions ever. I fucking rolled it. I had just gotten my paycheck and it was blowing around in my car because I had the windows down and  I was distracted trying to save it from blowing out the window and I went off the shoulder of the road, freaked out, over corrected and rolled onto the road.\nLuckily I came out with nothing but a broken hand. But that was enough to make me lose my job at Walmart and I couldn't participate in practice anymore obviously. Also I have a would-be badass scar on my hand but every time I look at it I just remember how dumb I am. I stopped seeing my friends everyday and didn't even want to go to camp anymore because it just sucked not playing. The county fair came around right before school started and that was fun. I saw my friends again and showed countless people my hand and told them what happened which sucked.\nSchool started and once again I told countless people the most embarrassing story of my entire life. The doctor said I would be cleared for practice about 3 weeks into the season so my hope for football kinda dropped from there. It was nice to see friends daily again but everyday sucked. I was depressed again and was always in my head. \nAfter I was cleared I didn't play all that much so when football ended I didn't care at the time. All that mattered to me was wrestling. We had a new coach who was probably the polar opposite to our last one who became the assistant coach. He had wrestled in college and was something of a wrestling legend in his hometown so we all wanted to make him proud.\nThe wrestling season went better. I was wrestling 132 and actually seeing myself in shape and 7% body fat made me feel so much better. I loved wrestling and it helped me not be depressed. I also got a therapist which helped a ton. I actually was pretty happy. The biggest downer was that I only won one match (It was my 3rd year). about three weeks until the end of the season the assistant coach tells me that I was ineligible and I tried to get my grade up but every time I'd get one up, another would drop. I eventually got kicked off the team right before regional which sucks.\nWhich brings us to now. I miss football and wrestling so much. They're all I think about, and I'm never going to do either again. During wrestling season I'd go to bed and imagine me winning a match and it would help me sleep. During football season I imagined making some play or doing literally anything and it just made me so hopeful that something would happen. Here I am now, 3 career wins in 3 wrestling seasons and no stats in 2 seasons of football. I wish I could go back in time and change everything but I can't. I feel depressed and anxious constantly. And on top of all of this I graduate soon and will probably never see allot of my friends again. And there's so much more but I already typed a whole novel. Maybe the next couple months will be different but I don't know. I feel like every time I get ahead or am happy some big stupid bull crap ruins it.",

Yesterday morning I but on some Alan Watts, walked her for like an hour, got high. We danced and played. Unfortunately I'm a 37 year old dope who had to move back with his mom cause I built no career skill that is highly sought after, and Las Vegas is a shit place to find work unless you love sales, cleaning others wastes, or had a recent lobotomy.\nDo lobotomies make life simpler for the person or is the poor bastard too scrambled to care I wonder?\nI wonder if lobotomies are still legal? Hmm.\nSo I dry up, grab my thickest coat, my dirtiest shoes and head out into the neon concrete desert that is Fremont Street aka '淥ld Las Vegas'? The original major strip of this carnival of adult amusements and hollow tourist distractions.\nI'm being overly negative without a hint of irony or humor, I'll explain Fremont for those who only visited once while drunkenly living what I'm sure you thought was gonna be a vacation similar of excitement and absurdity of say the film '淭he Hangover'?or have delusions but haven't visited yet.\nFremont Street is a strip mall that should of been flattened and turned into a park. At least all the homeless would have nicer conditions to sleep on at night. You can buy benzos off some kid in the middle of the street for less than it costs to park, the security and even the cops are out of shape with visible neck tats and look like they can't be bothered to run to their car let alone handle a crazy person if shit went down.\nThankfully Nevada isn't very violent. These thugs out here are made of paper and I'm not even an intimidating dude.Im like 123 lbs soaking wet with a neutron Star in my pocket, but my joy and wonder has been warped into reclusivity and bottled anger. So most people I've noticed recently just avoid eye contact now.\nNice in the moment, but like I said I ain't no tough guy. I just give them the stink eye so no one talks to me.\nAnyway enough of that shit, lets get to the dumb things and why I'm in my closet like a prisoner put in solitary.\nFor one, always wear an extra layer or two before walking in the cold. Did I forget to mention my license got suspended last month? I'm gonna clear it up next month and be back on the road, but yeah I decided to walk from my apartment to Fremont. \nThe walk was an hour and twenty....going one way, in 40 degree weather. I'm a fucking dummy. Can't stay inside though. Despite the fact that my whole day yesterday was just applying to jobs, mom came in and she needs help. So as long as I don't have full time work to help out, my brain is constantly chattering...\nIt's not good enough.\nOther men take care of their mothers around the age of 30. Are you a man?\nShe's being nice, but we both know you are a cancer to her life at this point.\nI'm a burden.\n..,yeah strolling aimlessly at 11pm alone is the smart thing to do right?! Let's go! Fremont was D-E-D. DEAD. So much for the city that never sleeps. I stopped by one of the two bars I've found in this state that agrees with me, Atomic Liquor. No one but two bartenders, a couple and the doorman were in attendance. Their was a motel across the street that caught my ear however.\nA gate locked monthly budget stay motel/apartments. I can't recall the name of the place but it's not important. Gaudy parking lot with what looks like a very well crafted twisting statue of a RV trailer standing up crooked yet steady in the middle of it, behind the locked gate like a silent guardian summoned by rednecks and PBR sacrifices.\nThe lot was lit up, but not one building had lights on. In fact the whole lot was empty. No cars, no ground security, and no people living in it. Last year this place was standing tall, with regular guests actual people staying in it. Some weekends people would have mini-block parties and performers in this place when the gates were open.\nNow, it's a creepy neon ghost town, that plays Sinatra to no one nonstop. I tried to make a video on it but I'm staying incognito here for now. In fact this is a growing concern in my neighborhood. As I was wandering, trying to get lost in the city. Going up Fremont their are several empty lots and locked up motels and single economy lodgings that are just empty, yet on that same corner I see dopesick and desperate people living in tents and wrapped up on the concrete sleeping.\nAll the money this city makes in tourism, alcohol sales, restuarants, CASINOS, yet I've never seen more homeless and people with little to no employment like Las Vegas. I'm went past three blocks of potential halfway houses and possible lodging for these people so they can at least start trying to get off their feet. Nope, their is a nasty ass Siegel Suites where hookers go to die every two blocks here that charges 200 a week though.\nThe really disturbing and fucked thing to me. Some of these abandoned buildings had paintings of fake doors and windows on them. I tripped out, they were colorful and well done. Lots of yellows and stark reds swathes the outside walls. Hell the painted windows even had sketches of people hanging out of them like friendly neighbors. But the doors weren't real, the windows weren't real.

The gates high and solid, maintained in better shape than the buildings it was protecting.\nWith that rolling around in my skull I was in no good shape to be alone (I wasn't actually alright that night to begin with) and eventually made the hour and a half trek back home. Right before I eventually went to sleep, which didn't happen until 3:30 am for those curious (I think Ive only managed about 4 hours of sleep in 48 hours, I was up at 7 am today for no fucking reason). Read another post I wrote on here, just to see if anyone gave a shit which some of you actually read, one guy even commented on it.\nAs goofy as it sounds I was dreading seeing any responses to it. I'll probably avoid reading this post for a while too. Way way too raw and sensitive, but I really want to improve my writing and my social skills are basically being rebuilt on Reddit so I welcome criticism.\nEven a '測our writing is pompous shit you pervert'?is a load healthier than what my demons keep whispering in my ear recently.\nNow that I think about it, why am I sitting typing this in my closet? \nOh yeah, it's comfortable.",

I'm currently in college which contributes to a lot of my anxiety - thankfully I'm about to graduate though.\nI have an internship, play club baseball (my favorite sport), see a psychiatrist weekly, and often play video games or watch TV shows. I don't drink or smoke, and I spend a good amount of time socializing with friends (I don't like socializing though and never really have, but that's a different story).\nBasically, my internship is in my dream job field and I'm sick of it already. I've played baseball my whole life, and often can't be bothered to go to practice. I'm taking classes on interesting topics, and often forget to do or ignore my assignments until after midnight the night before they're due. Video games only frustrate or bore me after a short time, and I don't care at all about any TV shows I watch.\nI feel like I'm very busy, doing a lot of things that should make me happy, but nothing is.

This is super long so there will be TLDR at the end...\nThe world is ending and that is the only way to describe how I feel. The world is ending and I'm suffocating but it's not to anybody else. \nBackground: I've had depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember. I have a wildly complicated/horrible relationship with my mother (a single mother who raised me, an only child, by herself) and a friendly relationship with my father who wasn't around much until I was like 10 so it's like not at all a parental kind of relationship. \nI'm in my last semester of college and it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I'm overloaded with 21 hours of classes and working 8 hours 2 days a week. \nI don't have any friends. I used to but as I get older the depression gets worse. My self esteem is wrecked. I have incredible social anxiety that's also gotten worse as I get older. The actual only human contact I have is my wonderful boyfriend (21M) who lives with me. He is patient and supportive in every way possible and showed me what love truly is. His family are amazing people and I love them too. They are everything I wanted in my family as a kid. \nI regularly see a therapist and a psychologist and am on medication. Two things have triggered my downward spiral: the loss of a written prescription of my antidepressants which has caused me to be off them for about a month (but I have since found and been back on them but only for about 5 days and this is also 100% my fault and I'm kicking myself for this) and the severing of my relationship with my mother. She had me young (21) and we have had a super insane relationship with no boundaries at all whatsoever. She is my absolute best friend in the whole world but also the cause of my depression and anxiety, regularly verbally and emotionally manipulating and abusing me since I hit puberty. \nBECAUSE OF ALL OF THIS I am incredibly depressed and anxious and it's getting worse with each passing day. Something new happens with my mother almost every day where she has been cold to me. But on top of this, I have been physically sick with the flu (which is going around in my area) &amp; it has caused me to miss my class last week. It is 3 days a week for 4 hours. But I am able to work at home because we use our laptops to run the program we work on, so I have been keeping up with schoolwork. \nLast Friday was our midway presentation on our final projects (I graduate this May) and I ended up having a full on panic attack because I didn't have enough money to print my presentation out on my university account and I left my wallet at home because my boyfriend drove me to school. It was already past time the class had started so I ran outside to try to calm down but everything had built up and I couldn't stop crying. Needless to say I didn't go to class. I emailed my professor an embarrassingly cringey email about what happened and he hasn't responded. (Attendance is important in this class)\nThis past weekend was Mardi Gras which I did NOT participate in because it turns out I have a sinus infection right after getting the flu. I have a dr note for this. \nI relapsed on my antibiotics and had to go back today to get a stronger prescription. Mardi Gras classes resumed today at 12:30. My class starts at 1:30. I got a drs note because I obviously still feel bad (coughing up mucus, sneezing constantly, blowing my gross snotty nose every 5 seconds, deep mucusy cough every 10 seconds. It's NOT pretty) and the class is freaking 4 hours long and I don't want to subject anyone else to that either??? The classroom is tiny. \nSo I sent him it. I said I can present when I come back this Friday. He has yet to respond to that too. \nI'm terrified I'm going to fail and not graduate. I have to graduate because I have an amazing job lined up for me afterwards.\nTLDR: it feels like bad thing after bad thing keeps happening to me and I really want to just give up but i have so much pressure to not give up that it makes me so fucking anxious!!!\nMy anxiety is CRIPPLING me right now. I don't really know why I posted this and I'm not really expecting any responses. But if you had any kind words to say that would be really appreciated...",

This sounds like I'm on the home stretch, but I really don't feel like it. While my depression has somewhat eased up over the past few months, it's been at the expense of any study motivation I have.\n       While I've never had much willpower when it comes to education, and have somewhat coasted through so far, this past year has been the worst. I'm at a top uni where falling behind is unacceptable. But that's not really the problem.\n     I DESPISE studying. I hate it with a passion, and I can't do even the simplest of tasks anymore. I feel nothing but frustration when I think about my degree subject; any interest I had is long gone and has been for years. Essentially, I'm done with this stage of my life and want to move on to working, doing what I love, as I know this is what will ultimately make me happy; a routine, structure, the chance to have some impact on real life, and meet new people.\n     The trouble is I've still got a year to go of this degree. I'm not dropping out now since I've invested so much time, struggle and money into the past four years. It's been gruelling but the end is in sight, and yet I feel ZERO motivation to get there. Which means I'm stuck in a constantly anxious rut, feeling trapped, and can't focus on anything I want to do because it doesn't have my full attention. I'm basically just in limbo right now. \n    Does anyone else have experience with feeling entirely mentally burnt out from studying in a high pressure environment, and any tips on how to get through this last year without falling into a major depressive spiral again? I just wanna get my degree and move on with my life. Any advice or solidarity would be much appreciated 鉂わ笍",

Like my stomach just feels low and it feels like that feeling you get when you're in a bad mood and your heart just drops to your stomach. This has been going on for a few days now and usually when I get those blue moods it goes away soon enough, mostly after the same day when I go to sleep and wake up, but this time it's different and this isn't the first time it happened. I've felt this sadness before too, for a few days and it scared me bc usually my low moods last only for a day and it isn't emptiness. Last time it went away tho, and I think this time it's not going away maybe bc I'm overthinking it? But then again if I'm overthinking, idk how to stop overthinking and that makes me more upset. I'm extremely sorry if this isn't depression and has insulted anyone, but I didn't know where else to ask this. It would be greatly appreciated if you could read this and lmk what you think it is. Maybe anxiety? I thought that, but I'm not scared of anything? I don't feel worried? It's just a low mood in my stomach. I wish someone who has knowledge of this answers me. I'm only 17, I wanna live a good healthy happy life and I really don't wanna be depressed, or constantly upset. I already booked a guidance appointment to talk to my councellor at school for this, and I'm too scared to tell my parents bc they'll think I'm overreacting or I'm too young to feel this way, or they'll just blame it on my phone and take it away, smthg that I REALLY don't want bc this is the only thing that takes my mind off my sadness sometimes. I don't have friends that I trust and am close to enough to tell them this. I'm also pretty lonely which upsets me at times, but not this much. Also I like bts, a bit band that makes million of ppl happy, and me too, but these days I only feel happy while I'm watching them, but as soon as the video ends, I'm back to that empty sinking feeling. Oh and I also cried my eyes out yesterday, which idk what for, but it made me feel better only for like 5 ish mins, then it was back to feeling sad AGAIN. And I cried today too, when I was coming home from school. Help?",

When I got into high school, it was my lifelong dream to stop being lonely and extremely sad and make a few good friends to hang out with, but instead I got made fun of having no friends and being '渢he weird quiet kid'?that I have been for the past 12 years of my long and pathetic life.

Here I sit in bed crying myself to sleep as a sophomore in high school, almost losing all of the few friends I have in my life. My pathetic life is quickly withering away from the constant battles with myself and high school society. All I want is a few good friends to laugh with and maybe a girlfriend too, but I feel so sad and tired all the time with constant thoughts of suicide. Last week, I stopped hanging out with my very school friends during lunch which caused me to just completely let go of the hope of a decent life like everybody else at school was privileged to get.

I'm living in a small backwater settlement with not much more than 4000 inhabitants; a kinda old-school place, where the middle-aged and older know each other pretty well, but the younger act like they were from the big cities.\nI never really felt like fitting in, but for majority of my lifetime I didn't paid attention to it, as it never really bothered me until recently.\nApart from a few occasional trips I never left my hometown. I was raised here. My family lived in a house with a nice big garden. Five of us. My maternal grandparents, my father, my mother and I, the only child. After being at age I was sent to preschool, but my parents took me out after less then a year, because I was always getting sick (minor colds, nothing serious, for somehow I always ended up beind sat right next to the window), and i was kept at home 'till elementary school. In school I was concidered a good (even exemplary, as they claimed) student and child. During my school years I always had exactly two close friends, everybody else was just an acquaintance, even in my own class. Until fourth or fifth grade there wasn't really any \"problems\" with me socially, but as puberty started to kick in amoung us, I slowly started to became the odd one. I always had long hair, and that alone was enough for the others to pick on me. Mix it with me being the \"nerd\" who always got good grades, was taken to competitions after competitions in natural science and literature subjects, hated popular music, listened to rock/metal, never went to parties or clubbing, didn't smoke, didn't got drunk with the others, never liked dancing or any sports. Also as puberty progressed started to I started to gain some weight. Nothing to sugarcoat (because I would eat that too) I was quite chubby. Not obese, but I had my handles.\nAfter finishing the elementary school, I attented to the local high school, (which is located literally next door to my elementary), with 85% of my old class, so we basically brought the social structures with us. Before that, we got distant and separated with one of my close friend up to the point that we didn't even spoke to each other for 16 years now. He got buddies with the rich kid of the class, they went to a different school, started clubbing, getting girlfriends, so he lived his normal life, in which there is no place for a nerd like me.\nDuring the 4 years of high school my non-existent social circle shrunk even more. I replaced my old friend with a new one, so there was three of us again, but apart from occasionally hanging out with them I started to keeping to myself more and more. The others were busy dating and partying, while my attention turned towards reading, paying attention to anything that was in english and playing computer games. I was still in the top of my class when it came to the grades, but I had to put literally zero effort in it. I've just read the given texts of the lessons once or twice, (even though I'm a very slow reader), said a few sentences when I was asked and it was enough for acing the four years. You can imagine what it did to my attention span, and willingness to put effort into anything.\nDuring the twelve years I tried to court two girls, but was rejected by both of them. When I told my mother about my first attempt at asking a girl out (one of my classmate in sixth grade) her reaction was very disapproving, along the lines of \"You shouldn\"t do that!\" which I think also added an extra weight to my baggage. After that, for a very long time I didn't even try to do any advance on any woman.\nI finished high school with an A+ degree in all subject (they even had mercy on me in sports). I took a succesful language exam in english far more earlier then the rest of the class, without attending to the extra and summer lessons.\nOf course, as \"bright child\" (buy only in a local sense as it turned out) I attended to a university right away. But... I didn't really gave it a thought. My family was not too wealthy, and I didn't wanted to overwhelm them financially. I was always said that I think maturely, more mature than my age, so that also reinforced my decision of attending to the nearest, cheapest possible university, from where I can get home in an hour so my parents don't have to pay for dorm and such. I literally just take the option of least resistance instead of taking a look into what I'm good at or what interests me. Now looking back this is one decision I regret.\nMaking friends was never my strong suit, and it didn't change during the university. But some of the teachers instantly liked me. I also gain entry to an ornithology group and was listed in the crew of the next offical, certified experiment run by my professor in my very first year.\nThen life decided to take a turn towards the more darker areas. After being done with my first year, during summer break, my mother get ill, almost died and spent 52 days in hospital, mostly in intensive care. I went to visit her every single day. Then it turned out that the complications and treatments given to her in attempt to save her life ruined her kidneys. From that moment we started a 6 years long struggle with all the few ups and the many downs. With dialysis, my mother temporarly got better for a while, but after a some time she just gave up on life, refused to attend to dialysis and in the end, let herself pass in excrutiating pain. We tried everything from being kind to being authoritive but nothing worked. The last line I heard from her was \"Go away! Go home! Leave me alone!\" as a reaction to my desperate attempt to get her to change her mind.\nThe next day she passed away when I was on my way to the hospital.\nDuring this period my grandfather was also getting more and more sick, with more and more severe complications from diabetes and aging. Under half a year I lost both my mother and my grandfather.\nMy grandmother was and is totally devastated by the events, yet, God bless her, she is still kicking and active, but the age and sorrow is slowly gaining on her. She often claimes that I'm the only reason she's still alive. My father become more closed and keeping to himself, however, lately he tries to be more open.\nOn my life the toll was huge as well. I dropped out of the university and stayed at home to help if needed. But in the peaceful days when everything was calm, and my help wasn't needed I started to seperate myself from the world more and more. With no friends, no money and no opportunities to blow off some steam, my only entertainment and escape were the books, movies and pirated video games.\nLater when money was thight I started to work at the local school as an administrator. I kept working there past the death of my mother and grandfather. Though it was offically a standard 9-5 job, my boss had her own civil organisation too, with which I was \"supposed\" to help, so I worked overtime and often during the night too. That once more locked me up in my office and my hometown for good. Apart from the occasional movie nights at the theatre in the nearest city I never really had a night off. The paycheck was enough to cover the bills and a few insurance but not much more. Travelling wasn't an option, because I didn't have money, and I didn't (and still do not) have a driver's licence. The overwork and working behind the desk took its toll on my physique too: I'm tall-ish, 185 cm, but also 130 kg, and I'm out of breath very easily if I have to maintan constant physical effort. The only thing I can do in a prolonged fashion is walking at a 2-3 km/h speed for hours, but I breaking out in sweat very, and I mean very easily (in the first 3 minutes), and my body is covered with soft fat tissue with no hardness of any muscle. These things hintered my confidence when it came down to approaching women as well. I tried to hit it off with two of my colleagues after a 15 years pause, but, again both of them rejected me. So I never really tried any harder than that after the repeated failures.\nI even gave up on making friends.The few people I know and hang out with are from my workplace. And even towards them I am more and more suspicious, especially since I (think) I learned to read body language and notice all the small details of aversion on them. As far as I can tell my relationship with them is contrversial at best, because if I organise something, they agree to tag along, but I rarely got invited by them.\nThe one thing that didn't change is that once again, I consider exactly two of them my close friend. A handsome young male dance teacher and a beatuiful young musician woman. We often hang out at my place, which I rent out to dance teacher (for dirt cheap, as I live in our family house with my grandmother and father) talking, getting drunk, playing some games and stuff. Sometimes they say that they like me, and they never ask me to leave, even if I tell them that they are free to do so, because I know that I'm difficult person to bear. But I just can't shake the thought of they being on \"good terms\" with me because that's how they \"repay\" me for I rent the place to the man for cheap and because I actively seek to help woman emotionally, beacuse she is a fragile soul (there was a few occasions when I spent a good portion of the night with her either in person or on the phone because she \"needed someone to talk\" to and reached out for me). This woman is also very attractive and kind, as they say a \"dame to kill for\", but I'm pretty sure I'm not her type and suspect that she and the dance teacher are attracted to each other, and are sleeping together, so no room for me in her life. They say that there is nothing between them apart from our friendship, but I know that to man made several attempts at seducing her, and as far as I can tell after half a bottle of hard liquor they playing the flirting game quite good. And that's just the things I see when I'm with them. That's why I constatly hint them that they can tell me to get lost if the had enough of my company).\nApart from the above as today, I still don't have a university degree, no driver's licence, and I recently left my job as well, becauce there was a change in the person of the director, and the new boss couldn't really support neither herself nor me against the attacks from a few co-workers and the members of the directional group originating nothing more but personal disdain. Luckily I had a few month worth of expanses saved up in cash, but now my money run out and I live off a loan and the rent the teacher pays me.\nI'm not without a job entirely, though, as a \"leading\" agent of an insurance company, who made a life insurance for my grandmother, took an interest in me (I was present, actively interfering with the processs when they signed the papers in order to keep my grandmother from accepting a disadvantegous offer), and she introduced me into a program for new agents with education, professional support and such. Because of this, I started to take driving lessons too, but I struggle with it. I also feel unsure about this job opportunity as an insurance agent, as it is a quite controversial trade; but everybody, who has authority in the program, even the regional director wants me to stay, even though I tried my best to scare them off.\nSo for now I still stick to it, because I think this is my only option to earn some good money as I have literally no other paper about any other, noteable qualification. The only \"certification\" I'm somewhat proud of is my offical MENSA membership (but I'm suspicious about that too, since I only passed for the second time I took the test; when they wanted to open a new local group in the county I live, so I wager they lent me a few extra points, so I pass 130 mark in order to gain more local members.)\nI couldn't stand to leave the country, because of my grandmother, who is still deathly afraid of me gettig hurt or in trouble if I don't spend the night at home.\nSo here I am, jobless, moneyless, without a car, out of oppotunities. A kissless virgin, who doesn't even bother to approach woman anymore, because I can tell at least a dozen reasons right from the top of my head why they should reject me and go for someone better (what measn literally any other man than me).\nBut the hardest part of all: I literally have absolute zero motivation or interest towards anything. I can't tell why I keep waking up in the morning and do the tasks I'm trusted with. I think it's not even depression as for most of the time I feel and think about absolutely nothing, it's just static in my brain. Other times I just feel anything apart from rage, despair, incompetence, overwhelming impotence and being sick with everything. I don't even feel the need to change or improve my life anymore because as I see it, it would be so much effort for literally nothing. I feel the discomfort of not having this or that but only when I witness others living their life. And sometime I can logically prove myself that I would need this and that if I try. But that's it. All are fleeting all so quickly.\nYeah, I could earn more money, but for why? My standards are pretty low: a place to sleep with a computer and internet acces, some food, and a bathroom.\nGetting an SO? Why? And how? I mean I would like to have a family and children, of course, but first I would need to induce emotions other than disgust or disdain in a woman and keep her attention for more then two minutes. But I'm so incompatible with people that it does not go for me just like that, naturally. It would take an enourmous amount of effort and even if I would somehow accidentally succeed, there's still a high chance that she would just leave me after I realize that I'm the most boring person in the world. My life is so bleak and blank that when I'm with my \"friends\" I keep making up stories about the adventures and exes I had when I was younger in order to I have something to talk about. And even though I try keep these stories consistent, I feel they see right through it but feel so sorry about me that they just let me keep talking.\nHonestly, all I want to do is run away. I'm tired of my life, I'm tired of myself. I'm uninterested in everything. I just do things so people leave me alone about it. Because I still hear from the few of them saying \"why don't you do something with that big brain of yours?\" \"Why don't you get a nice lady for yourself?\"\nBECAUSE I CAN'T, THAT'S WHY!\nBecause there is no place for me in this entire goddamned world. Because all I get is disdain. Which is replaced by hatred if I warn others about something and it turns out that I was right. Like I'm not even allowed to be correct about anything. \"Smile more!\" \"Be kinder\" \"Ask about and talk with people\" they say! Of course, &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; should go out of my way just to get a whole lot of ignorance in return.\nThey just keep talking, but don't know, they just don't understand! The suggest me to make friends... in a settlement where I'm the wierdo, who was accused with basically everything from being a homosexual through being a pedofil to being a drug addict?! Are they even aware what they are talking about?\nI'm also tired of that few people giving me more credit than I worth. Because I literally worth nothing. That's literally my life: I'm either prasied for something I'm not or I'm the last, forgotten piece of shit.\nIn my younger age I was actively advocate against suicide. Now I wouldn't mind if somehow all of this just would end.\nI want people to let me go. I don't want to die explicitly. I just want a place where noone knows me. Were noone expects or want anything from me. A place where I can finally make peace with the piece of deadweight I am on this world and live the rest of my miserable life in seclusion, being THAT wierdo from the third floor, who you just see the corner of you eye in the morning and in the evening.\nI just want the world the stop remind me about what they think I should be. I know I had dreams, I know I had potential. I could have been an astronomer, a doctor, an actor, an electrician, or just a simple family man. But that's the point. I COULD have been. But it's over. It's in the past. I can't be any of those things anymore.\nI just want people to finally agree with me that I played all my cards wrong, succesfully wasted my life, never lived up to my potential, scream and yell at me for being an utter piece of shit, then throw me away and let me wither in peace. I simply ask the world to leave me alone without giving me signs of \"Hey! Why don't you do this or that?\"\nIs that so much to ask?",

Last night I was in an accident and my honest to god first thought was '渟hould I just end it?'?: Last night I was involved in an auto accident on my way home from work. It was not my fault, but my vehicle is most likely totaled and I will probably still owe money on it after everything is payed out. I do not have a car. I do not have a credit card so it will be hard to rent one, and I am 23 so I will have to pay extra fees on top of that. I only had this car for 3 months.\nLast month I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. It has so far been an easy transition into my new lifestyle but I fear for the medical bills starting to pile up.\nI am currently $80k in debt with student loans. \nWhen I graduated college no one would even give me an interview. I accepted my first job offer but work in a miserable job field with an overbearing boss. I work as a driver manager and manage a fleet of trucks but we have been severely lacking freight options these past couple months which has led to me not meeting my revenue expectations, leading to my boss being on my case every second of every day. Due to my illnesses I have had to miss numerous days of work and now I fear (without a car) I will not be able to make it to work and, along with me not meeting expectations, will lead to me being fired. \nWhich if I am fired, I will further be in debt seeing as just two weeks ago I signed a lease for a new apartment and am locked in until next February.\nI don't know what to do. I am 100 miles from my family (had to relocate for my job) and  am in an increasingly unstable financial situation. I am lonely, my only social interactions are at work or on Xbox live. I am too poor to go out and all my friends live back home. I feel isolated",

I mean I went to her because I thought (+was told) that I have depression by the people around me, but it helped hearing it from someone official.  Currently, I would say I've been doing better compared to a few months ago with a combination of understanding my heightened anxious feelings, medicine, and gym. \n**The Situation:**  My boss called me to his office and pointed out something that was due from me for a while.  We talked some and the summary basically being \"help me, help you\".   He paused for a while to figure out the right word he wanted to use and said, \"Yes. Self-destructive. That's what you are self-destructive\".  He said, \"I don't know what happened to you when you were a kid but stop thinking you'll be unsuccessful and that you don't deserve it\".  He gave examples, \"...not completing hours on time was asking to be fired, missing meetings, coming in late. These are all self-destructive acts.\" He is all in all supportive. He said him and the team likes me and that occasionally I'll produce good work which is why haven't been fired.  I realised that I've been self-destructive not only at work but also at home.   \n**Question:** If anyone, even in an intimate setting (Eg. home with gf / therapist), asks me do you want to get fired, or do you want to not graduate.  I could not logically conceive, even as the best devil's advocate, any reason to be self-destructive.  But then my actions say otherwise.  I feel that unconsciously I feel that I am worthless, though in a conversation that idea won't even come to my head. This **really bothers me** because I can self-reflect fairly well.  But I wouldn't be able to begin describe why in the moment I chose to do those things that I know will end up hurting me.  \nI feel that this may be a common enough trait, that I don't think I'm alone here.  But I would love to read other people's views on my or their situations for this.  \nP.S. -  I really resonated with this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9esueu/anyone_else_feel_worthless_after_making_a_simple/e5rc5x6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), which then inspired me to reach out here. \nTL;DR:  Don't think I'm worthless.  Cannot imagine a reason why I would think I am worthless, but a lot of my actions are self-destructive and highly point towards that I, unconsciously think I am worthless.  And sadly, my actions do speak louder than my intent (words).",

And you can experience all these things at same time. It's confusing. It's mind draining. It's beautiful and full of hate all at once, when your heart is broken. Being ugly does not deal with your appearance. It's all about who you are. We are all ugly. We are all beautiful. We are all disappointing. We all are wonderful. But what you do with it matters. I personally can't help but be ugly. I cannot stop it. But neither can the person I want to be beautiful the most. The person you want to help the most is the most horrible person. That's why you love them. That's why you want to help them and to fix them. They can't be fixed. Could you though? They don't accept help, but you can. This is for my daughter. Someone I most desperately want to save from an ugly, beautiful person. My heart is torn and my mind is being ruined. I find myself slip away until I see them both. I only then, remember love. I remember a love I will always have. A love I shouldn't have, but still do. Wanting to protect them is natural. Wanting to protect yourself is natural. The problem? You can only pick one. After picking one, you still don't win. You live with it. No matter how painful this is, you cannot give up. Do not give anyone that power. Nobody deserves power over you. But you should never place your heart and give away someone else's at the same time. Pick your real love. Pick yourself. Pick your child. Your family. But never place your feelings into something else just because you feel over and out. Put your heart where it belongs and figure yourself out. First and foremost, love yourself, love your family. And do not let anyone get to you because you are alone. Let them earn it. You earned love for yourself. Don't let strangers pretend to earn their way. Time is on your side. And you deserve the best. Stop yourself from desperate pleas for attention. Find yourself. Love yourself. Love the people that matter. Don't look for something that isn't real. \n-for my daughter, for myself, for my stupid, beautiful ex.",

To be honest she's the only reason i keep going, but I repeatedly push her away, i refuse to hang out or talk to her, she'll insist on giving me hugs and I'll refuse.

        "query": "Becoming Independent : Lately i've been very depressed about the idea of becoming independent and growing to be an adult. Im 17 and I'm suppose to gradate this year, but never have this feeling of anxiousness  and fear not *dwell* on me. growing up i was very sheltered and till this day i still consider myself sheltered. I've never really gone out and seen the world, I've only been informed of the dangers by my mom because luckily she got to see it herself. And while i am so pleased that i was told about those dangers unlike some people who've been sheltered, it feels as though i cannot entirely accept that fact. I'm a very sensitive person and I dont even know how to defend myself. throughout my years of schooling, I've always been bullied and too afraid to defend myself, I don't know where this trait of mine came from because I consider both of my parents to be very guarded and defensive. I hate the fact that I haven't developed that side to me. another thing about me is that I'm almost like a baby inside. Can't handle too much pressure. At home i act like a little kid but once i step foot into the outdoors, there's like this mask that comes upon me out of nowhere, and I feel as though i have to behave as this sophisticated being. idk how to act like myself in public. im always hiding my true feelings because im afraid of judgment. the person that people have perceived me to be is not at all how i perceive myself. I'm not defensive, i'm not assertive, and i don't even know who i am. I'm a sensitive child inside who on the outside is looked to be something im not. and i honestly hate it. today I asked a woman if i could borrow her phone and she gave me a rude stare, as though she was disgusted with me and my overall presence. On the outside I looked like i couldn't care less that she behaved that way towards me, but in reality i was going to cry my eyes out. little things really hurt me and it sucks that im that way. I really wish i was this bold person who could handle a kick in the ass,but I can't handle anything and it makes me worry to death about the future. I've been very depressed about the idea of being on my own and getting out into the real world, because this world is so cruel and i don't think i could possibly handle it. I feel like im too sensitive in this world and everyone runs over me. People tell me im independent. and of course that's because of my reputation of being an introvert. I like being alone but some if it has to simply do with not being judged or hurt, or not being accepted or whatever but i'll say this now. I am not independent and that's just the truth. I thought i was independent all these years but i feel as though im not. I can barley shop without freaking out because im so worried about what other people think of me. I can hardly order food alone. Talking on the phone and making important calls is an issue for me. Im so tired of people assuming im just this serious person who has their shit together because honestly that aint even me. Im just a child inside. :/// idk what this is but i guess you can call it a vent of mine. im sorry this is so unnecessarily long and all over the damn place.",

I was barely eating. My diet was entirely Addy, energy drinks and the occasional hamburger. \nSo that was my life for like a year. I got out every now and then but mostly I was inside playing games and abusing drugs. Not very fun... \nThen I moved out to my mom and stepdad's, didn't really want to, but I figured it might be nice to get a fresh start. It started off nice at least. \nBut my step dad is an alcoholic, it's so bad that on the occasions where he makes food you can smell it in the food. I can also smell it when he's halfway across the house. He constantly calls my mom a cunt, a slut, every name in the book pretty much. \nAnd then there's my biggest personal insecurity... My teeth. My own complacency has cost me them and I need to have some work done eventually. \nAnd we'll I guess things are looking up? I have a counselor now.

I see a therapist next month,but I'm optimistic and pretty sure I will just be told to stop talking to these women that I have made friends with and shared feelings with and just focus on my own self and my kid,but I don't have a life.

More importantly I just want some advice on how you control it and what has helped you? \nToday I had a rage attack in my car on my lunch break at work. I got triggered from a phone call from somebody (customer service associate) dealing with my car insurance and I just snapped... I just screamed and cried on the phone cursing and berating the person and hung up and then immediately called my boyfriend uncontrollably screaming and crying in my car when I finally yelled the words I just want to fucking hurt somebody. I don't really feel the need to hurt others it is only in these rage attacks fueled by my depression that comes back to haunt me every month or so.\n My rage has caused me to black out. I have bashed my fists into the wall making my knuckles bleed. Have banged my head against the wall, clawed at my skin, ripped my hair out. I used to stab my mattress with a knife but I have tried to make progress on my own and stopped self harm actions completely... my boyfriend is very supportive and we acknowledge my issues when I start going back into depression... \nLately I think the anger has been resurfacing because I just feel like There is no god. That I'm an animal for slaughter. I used to be '渟piritual'?but I just ruminate on my own death every day and think about how nothing matters. And it makes me angry. Black out angry where I become a toxic person. \nI become a verbally abusive, screaming, uncontrollable person. And it leads me to very dark places where my mind loses control. I am angry at everyone and every thing and it feels like I can't get myself back followed by deep shame when I have an outburst.\nHow do I gain control? Or start to gain  more control? I want to be a calmer person. I feel as if I make progress and I won't have a rage attack for about a month and then I give in and just lose it completely. Like something just ticks and goes off in my head and I completely just want to lose it. \nAny advice is helpful, thanks guys.",

It gets to a point where you see the dead and lifeless masks we call '渉umanity'?as dark creatures that devour everything in their path in hopes of filling the void within by any means; even forcing each-other to drag ourselves through this hellish realm because we're too selfish to endure the loss and unreality of our so called '渟table &amp; civilized'?world. I do not know who, why, where, when, or how I am. Neither do you. The linguistic models we place in reality are nothing but sign posts leading the way; merely angelic whispers cast upon the brisk night of the cosmos.",

I really need some help processing this. : So yeah, my mom dropped this on me last night while out at dinner. I'm having a hard time processing it. I'm 25 M and due to some personal stuff from 2018, I've been living at home since. My family is small, it is just me, my mom, and my dad. I am an only child. My moms sister and parents live close by and i rarely see my dads family because they are up in New England. The thought of this complete change in the dynamic of my family is honestly scary.\nLast night, with the assistance of my aunt, my mom told me that on friday, she is moving out and into a new house not too far away that she has decided to start renting. Apparently for the past 3 weeks she has been slowly moving some of her things in. She plans to do inform my dad that she is filing for divorce via a letter on the counter (this is what she was told to do by her attorney, from what i understand she wasn't even supposed to tell me). He gets home noon on saturday, and I am the one who is supposed to be picking him up. This is what is honestly destroying me the most. He has no idea what is about to hit him and i do. My mom begged me not to tell him and i still haven't. i just don't know what i'm supposed to do knowing what he has waiting for him at home. He isn't going to take it well. He is catholic and tends to hold onto some of the traditional ways. I know it is going to really hurt him and it is hard to just watch from the sidelines. I seriously do not know how to best handle this situation. I've become sort of isolated from my old friends since moving back home and i don't really have anyone to talk to anymore. I was just about to reapply for college and finish my degree but now, i have no idea what the next 6 months looks like for me.\nTheir marriage:\nI can't really remember the last time they were happy. They don't hate each other but there is always tension. It is to the point where they both just assume the other is in a bad mood which leads to a perpetual bad mood that never gets better. My mom definitely has some issues she needs to work out as far as anxiety and all that goes. My dad seems like he's been depressed forever now and has always talked about how he'd love to transfer his job up north somewhere but never considered it because of my moms job and the fact we've kinda settled here. Overall, a very complacent relationship. My dad is pretty traditional so divorce has always seemed taboo.\nMy mom stayed with my aunt last night because i preferred to be by myself last night but she is coming back home tonight and we will probably talk about things. I don't know how to express that i am angry with how she handled this. I always been bad at expressing my emotions especially if it will upset someone else. I don't ever want anything to come between myself and my parents. they are the most important people in my life, they're all i've really got. What scares me is that if my mom does end up making me essentially be the one to tell him, that will cause irreparable damage.\nThere's obviously a lot more i could add to this but I'm having a hard time putting this post together as it is so feel free to ask questions. Any help is greatly appreciated.",

        "query": "Spouse Struggling with Depression and Im Completely Lost : My wife has been dealing with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her (10 years in August). Last year she started getting more help with this and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. They started her on some medication which has helped... But she really started spiraling late last year. She went from working a full time job, progressing in her career, and being involved with our family and dogs, to drinking heavily, which led to becoming alcoholic, and now she's on FMLA to get it all under control. The alcohol part has gotten better, but between doing treatment at a facility and attending AA plus her medication, she's completely wiped of energy every day. I am trying to help and be supportive, but I'm also holding down my own work and all the financed to keep us going so I'm pretty wiped too. A lot of her identity was tied to her job, so it's really a struggle for her without it, but there's no way she could go back right now and do anything with these energy levels. FMLA will run out soon, and I doubt she'll be in any state to go back by then, but I don't know what else to do. We've talked about her just quiting, but it's a great job otherwise with great benefits and pay, and again it's really tied to her identity. I think the freedom from not working would be great until she's got a better handle on the depression and anxiety, but how of I even start to say that? I'm really worried she'd just spiral.worse without something to do or some other purpose. We've tried exercise, getting outdoors, games, crafts, and other stuff to find hobbies that might call to her, but nothing really fills that job-shaped void so far. We're only 28. We have vacations and events planned months out, but I can't see us doing any of them. We've only told her side of the family. They're supportive and try to help, but they live on the east coast and we're on the west so there's only so much they can do. No one on my side of the family or any of our friends know really. I feel guilty wanting to tell folks to explain why I'm flaking out on them or not participating, but I have this whole other thing going on in secret, and her needs come before them. I have zero experience with any of this. I keep hoping there will be some guidance counselor or advisor to come in and explain what the actual real difference is between leave vs disability, and who else we should be seeing or talking to, and what a realistic time table is for any of this, and in general how to get my wife back. Maybe she'll never be back to 100%, but I still love her, and it's tearing me apart not knowing how to help her. AA folks say the family has to be able to go on in their own life and not be dragged down by the person's addiction, but with depression and anxiety, I'm scared to death of what would happen if I'm not there supporting her every day. None of this is her fault. She's trying really hard every single day. We're both very detailed people who like to plan ahead, so the ambiguity of it all is driving us nuts. Like some days we might go to the mall, do a workout, play with the dogs, and make dinner together like nothing ever happened. Some days we may not leave the bed and just watch Gilmore Girls while eating only peta bread. There's no rhyme or reason. I'm really sorry for all of this wall of text, but I think it at least helps me to say (write) it just to vent. If you made it this far, thanks! Good luck to everyone. You matter.",

I went up there and we ended up having sex. \nA few days ago I went to his house to hangout and I ended up falling asleep for close to 8 hours on his bed instead of hanging out with him.

When we got to the restaurant I told him I didn't want anything to eat and I basically just sat there and watched him eat while I drank soda and played on my phone. I don't like eating in front of people or going inside restaurants to eat which is why I didn't eat.

        "query": "Some of my perspectives on depression : I've spent a decent amount of time on here reading posts and also a good amount of my life depressed. I wanted to share some of my observations on depression that I don't hear about too often. \n\"1a) Vicious cycles of depression:\" \nMany of us know depression as a cycle that feeds on itself as sustenance. If we're depressed because we're lonely that depression also makes it more likely that we avoid social interaction making us more lonely making us more depressed and so forth compounding onto itself. You may find this to be very devastating but I believe knowing depression as a cycle can be useful if the psyche is ready to step out of the cycle. Cycles are like false traps, to explain this idea I want you too understand cycles in other things in life. All life is cyclical and all cycles sustain themselves by repeating the cycle. One example is the water cycle where water evaporates by heat into the atmosphere until it cools and collects until to fall back down as rain. I suggest you think about other cycles because this may help your understanding of cycles. The interesting thing about cycles is that they cannot sustain themselves in and of themselves. All cycles have some kind of mysterious force or energy that kicks starts and then sustains them. In the case of the water cycle it is the heat generated by the sun. So there's an interesting paradox here that applies to the cycle of depression. Even though the cycle seems perpetual like a never-ending dark night or you feel trapped in the cycle of depression that seems endless there does not exist any cycle in life or of life that is able to sustain itself in and of itself. There is always something mysterious something beyond fueling it. If this source energy could be located and eliminated it would also end the cycle.  \n\"TL:DR\" Cycles are not internally sustainable such as the cycle of depression. If one could be successful in determining the external energy fueling the cycle the cycle can discontinue. \nIf 1a didn't work then continue to 1b \n\"1b) All sources to cycles are ultimately mysterious:\" \nIf 1a didn't work for you you've got other problems. Sometimes we can locate the source and transcend the cycle, sometimes not. If you are reading this then you tried to locate the source of your depression. What happens is that you may find a potential source but upon further inspection of that source it itself revealed itself as another cycle a bigger cycle or a more complex cycle and now you nonetheless hopelessly find yourself back where you started or in an even bigger mess of cycles. To illustrate this picture we can talk about the water cycle. We know the water cycle is powered by the heat of the sun. The heat of the sun is due to none other than the nuclear fusion cycle. If we were to inspect more closely the nuclear fusion cycle we would also see that this cycle is also created by other cycles. So we see here that all sources to cycles are cycles so cycles are cycling themselves. This is contradicting 1a isn't it? I did say this was paradoxical. In this state advice or knowledge isn't going to help you anymore because you're actually trapped in the cycle of knowledge, if you made this your profession you'd be called an epistemological philosopher. Realize the reality of this code of language is knowledge it's the very poison that is feeding your cycle of knowledge you are trapped in. Period. What do you do? Idk God help you. \n\"2) Depression as a deeply personal thing\" \nMany of us know depression is very personal but I don't mean personal as in my private parts are personal. I mean personal as in for each of us it is very much our own and no two is it the same. A burden for most of us to carry at times but deeply ours. We experience this when we try to explain our depression or seek understanding or empathy we may often find the people we explain it to don't quite understand where we are coming from or may even degrade you making you feel worse than had you just kept it to yourself. Can you remember a time perhaps before you were depressed wouldn't it have been extremely difficult to understand depression in that state? Or maybe your memory is really fucked well consider this. Imagine going to a Chinese guy and explaining simple instructions in English, he just doesn't speak your language man. Or consider birds after a major financial crash and recession every other wallstreet wolf is jumping off a building but the pigeons don't give a shit they'll happily peck away at your succulent corpse. My point is that the world isn't depressing you're depressing. You're this package of depression like a hard drive with 500 gbs worth of depression. Some may find this to be a continuous struggle but I offer the opposite perspective. Everything in your life since your birth up until this point has made you depressed in exactly the way you are depressed right now down to the most minute of details. Well, at worse a terrible life or at best a kind of sadistic trip. If you're a higher functioning depressive you may find this perspective useful, because you might be more capable of taking on your depression. Is it possible to be happily depressed? To in a way own your depression as a signature or birthmark? Like \"Bitch please even if I'm orgasming I'm still like kill me please\"  because that's my truest self. \nTL:DR Depression isn't just a phase I'm going through dad, it's my lifestyle\n3) What If I'm really fucking depressed and about to kill myself FOR REAL \nAt lot of people in the past have done it many more will do it in the future. Bet you didn't think I'd say that. That's just the truth it seems you wanna know the truth. They say when you die you get to find out what life is all about so basically the truth right? Well maybe that's you, let's just say it is. Many people have killed themselves for all types of reasons. Some did it accidentally they just fucked up once oops and they died for it blood on their own clumsy ass hands and feet. Some because they were seriously fucked deep in enemy territory maybe tortured for weeks months starved and at the brink of death, they thought lets just get this over with. Some because they just said life's not for me or shit has changed I'm done with this crap to hell with it. Some because of anger like I'll show those asshats when they find my corpse they'll know what's up. Some in glory like those guys that went into the nuclear reactor they knew they were gonna die. They saw purpose beyond their flesh and bones a legacy beyond their conscious life. For all of us our destiny is death, and for a small minority of us it will be directly connected to our own actions. But here's a shower-though don't we all die indirectly because of our actions and isn't that indirect suicide? Sure you didn't know or sure it wasn't my fault I got cancer or it wasn't me who choose to be born and now subject to the destiny of dying but you're like that baby screaming away after it's been shot out of the cannon straight into a wall of spikes. I mean it's already too late you're donezo kid. You were finished the moment you were born and so was I. Dead but alive another paradox for you, I know someone out there likes these. But here's the thing, before you pull that trigger, really how dead seriously sure are you that your destiny lies in lead? Or in Pills or underwater or hanging from a tree? That's all on you homie. \n4) Killing yourself is like quitting. Fuck Quitters, Quitters go to hell\nI'm saying this because we human's have a serious thing against quitting. And rightfully so but maybe not in the reasons you may expect. To explain I want to talk about evolution. Probably none of you are into bush-crafting but I'm sure you've all seen Bear Grylls drink his own piss, so you should know how motherf$#king hard it is to survive the old fashion way. However, we humans have done that for way way longer than we have been jerking off at our screens. At a very very deep level us humans were selected by nature to perform and survive or die. After many many generations of this we have you and me in the year 2020. So you can imagine why we hate quitting and therefore hate quitters. In the wild you could not quit, you could not take a depression day to cry and eat pizza and snuggle with your body pillow. You had to be 100% on and ready for anything. Always planing ahead, preparing for the night, preparing food, fixing tools, etc. etc. In the modern day we call this studying for exams, practicing your arts, investing for the future, work hard and working smart, \\[Insert Any Tony Robbins Quote\\], etc. etc. We put a ton of value on these things because we're in it and don't realize it. I don't mean to knock on it but to show that it can be seen as a game. Life as a game, as something not totally dead serious, and as with all games intended for us to have fun. \nOk I'm tired you're probably tired too getting to here sorry for the typos and grammar stuff   \nNo I'm not gonna kill myself, please leave me alone.",

The title basically says it.\nI'd been mulling over this for at least a few months now, ever since she told me she cheated on her boyfriend of over a year. That might seem insignificant but she was around when I was cheated on and she got to see how emotionally broken I was afterwards, even up to this day. She saw me go from a sad, but relatively 'normal' person into the paranoid, emotionally broken mess that I am nowadays.\nI wish I could explain it in a way that everyone reading this would understand it but I just can't really put into short enough sentences the way it changed the course of my life and my emotional development after it happened. She saw the way that it ruined me as a person and how it ruined the way that interpersonal relationships are formed for me now. I think what I'm trying to say by pointing that out is that she saw the way it fucked up her friend, and it astonishes me that she so happily did it to her own partner.\nBut yeah. He never found out and with my exit from their lives I don't think he ever will. I saw too much of myself in him after I found out what she did to him that I couldn't spend the time around him without crying the same night. After I found out, it brought all the same nightmares back that had been slowly slowing down. He's in the same position I was in and he would probably react the same way too, and I just can't be the one who does that to a person. I can't be the one who turns his world from an okay one to one where everyone is lying to him.\nI didn't say goodbye, I don't see too much to gain out of saying goodbye to her.

And it's further complicated because I can't afford to go home, and he can't come up here to see me because 1: he's busy taking care of his stepfather and 2: His parents don't know we're gay. I hate not being with him so much. We talk occasionally but it feels like he's so distant and doesn't want to be with me. I get that he's busy and way more antisocial than I am but I hate it so much. Before we started dating I used to be in a very dark place. I was closed off from the world and everyone else around me until I met him. I wouldn't talk to anyone and I had no idea why. I was just constantly depressed. I later found out that I had depression and anxiety severely, and it had been inherited from my mom (I didn't know that was a thing). It didn't help that my mom was one of the stricter kinds, and forced me to close myself off from friends for whatever reason at a very young age. She's gotten a lot more accepting since then, and I love her to pieces. I'm getting off track. Anyways, I always felt at peace when I was with my boyfriend, and I love him so much for that. He helped me out of a very dark place and I can't thank him enough. But after tonight I just miss him so much that it feels like I'm in that dark place again and I hate it. I'll occasionally feel like this but it goes away after a bit. But this time it's different. I had just gotten off the phone with him and I just felt so bad. Nothing went wrong with the conversation or anything like that. I just hadn't heard his voice in so long that I missed him so much. I hate feeling like this. Tonight was the first night in a long while that I actually cried over something.",

In 5th grade, not a lot of people liked me, and throughout middle school I was mostly shunned for being the weird kid. The only reason why I had a friend group by that point is because my best friend since 2nd grade introduced me to his friends throughout the years. Now, I'm in 11th grade, and things have only gotten worse. The summer between 9th and 10th grade I started drinking and hit a low point in December where I attempted suicide. Afterwards, things got better for a little bit. I felt better, more confident, and even got a girlfriend. I stopped drinking for the most part and had fun for a while. Taylor cheated on me and I got back to drinking. That brings us to now. I don't have my license and I'm 17. I'm addicted to alcohol and regularly smoke cigarettes, and I've been trying to pull through by telling myself that when high school ends, I'll be free.

No doubt, as I'm a teenager, all of those feelings just keep getting amplified.\nBut in times like this, when the storm's decided to go away for a while, I just see nothing there. Nothing of merit, but nothing to disdain. Nothing useful, but nothing detrimental.

I had 9 Seroquels left in the bottom of my container and I don't know if that's enough, but I've been struggling with relentless anxiety and panic attacks since I've returned to school after some brutal set backs. I were to end my life, I would never get to eat chocolate again, have an orgasm, hear my favorite songs, never get to see another Summer night, etc. Those things may seem cheesy, but I often think things like \"what about my family and friends??\" Last night I didn't think about how others would feel if I were to give in. Truth is,  most people in my life don't understand what I am going through and all they see is the goofy smile and they laugh when I tell jokes. When I let my guard down, people always respond with toxic positivity and platitudes. I hear a lot of people telling me not to be depressed or get back on the horse. Depression doesn't work like that. If all I had to do was snap my fingers, I would have tried that already. Today I got some help and spoke with a counselor at my University and on my way home tonight I'm going to pick up a strawberry milkshake. Depression has kicked my ass this winter and I've lost nearly 15 pounds. I know this low will pass and there will be more hurdles to come, but I'm fighting with everything I got. If you read this far, you're awesome!! Putting my words out into the universe helps with the burden and I don't feel so trapped behind my mask.\nPlease don't give up.",

        "query": "Don't know how to get better when I can't talk to anyone about my thoughts : It's too hard to talk to people. Even professionals.  \nI don't have any faith that anyone can actually help me and the process of going through all my emotions again with some one who can't even help me anyways is too much.  Sometimes, I'm even physically unable to talk. I tried SO hard today to speak up in a mental health group I attend daily but i just PHYSICALLY COULDN'T. Which just made me feel even worse.  \nEvery single day I've been crying because how of pointless and hopeless everything is. My entire life has been racked by depression and I'm so fucking sick of half living but nothing helps. I'm tired of going through medicines and therapists and all this stupid shit when it doesn't do anything.  \nI've been starting to feel suicidal again lately. I used to go to an emergency mental health center when I was feeling suicidal, but the last time I went there I had a bad experience and so all my trust is gone. I can't go there again and I don't want to go to the emergency room because they're just going to have me wait around anyways too.   \nIt's too humiliating to cry around people. I don't want to be around people when I cry. I don't want to go to an emergency room full of people when I'm at my worst just to feel like fuckin Boo Boo the Fool as i cry waiting around for 3 hours for some one to be available.  I also don't want to be committed to the hospital, either.  I'd just be going through unnecessary suffering being committed because they can't help my depression anyways. \nIt's too hard to talk to anyone. I don't trust anyone enough to actually open up to them. I barely see my therapist these days and even the medication I take is getting harder as I have no income and they're getting too expensive with the small copay.  Getting refills is about to be 10 times harder because my therapist office is refusing to accept refill requests via email anymore. I tried ttelling them hey i PHYSICALLY CAN'T SPEAK due to anxiety when I use the phone and they're like \"Well u know u just have to call and u can talk to me or to ur therapist :) \" and im liek BITCH DID U FUCKING HEAR ME? i PHYSICALLY. CAN'T. SPEAK. It doesn't matter if it's you or fuckin former preside obama i'm talkin to i LITERALLY CAN'T. It's pretty damn clear I'm not being listened to or taken seriously. So,  my only option for refill requests is to now hope that on the  very few days where I'm actuall there each month, I've got enough energy left over after a therapy session to talk to some one else to request a med refill.  I guess again it doesn't amtter anyways since I can' afford the medicine and I can't ask my dad for more money,. I have no income because i can no longer work due to how bad my mental illness has gotten. Disability is IMPOSSIBLE to get so I don't even bother applying for that. I've been denied twice already. And the forms are too fucking difficult to fill out, it's SO MUCH, and because i can't open up to anyone or trust anyone, it's too difficult to try and get any kind of help from anyone to fill them out.   \nI'm just so fucking angry and frustrated. This is all too hard. Seeking help is too fucking hard, it's too hard and painful to try and open up to some one when they can't do anything for you anyways and you just don't trust them because you know they just don't care at the level you need them to. I can't talk to my dad about anything because it's too hard worrying him or explaining anything to him. I don't want to be around people or make friends or anything, it's all just too difficult.   \nI really don't know what to do. I really really don't want to live like this anymore, but I'm not strong enough to do what it takes to get better because I can't TRUST any of the people that are supposed to be there to help me.  I go to a daily mental health group program everday and no one ever obthers coming to check up on me. I was told that I'd get a weekly check-in with my case coordinator but it doesn't end up happening. Today, one of the coordinators there took my easide to \"cHeCk iN\" she said, and im like \"okay cool, finally maybe some one is showing some caring about me!\" and it turns out no she didnt' wanna check in she just wanted to scold me for something  idid in a group last week and hten send me on my way without asking me how i been doing. its too hard to approach anyone myself, and its hard enough to speak up when people DO come in and ask hme how im doing. i literally have no way of communicating to some one i'm doing bad if they don't even bother to check on me, though.   \nit's just all so fucked. I don't know why i'm going there every day when i don't feel like it's doing anything for me. it hasn't opened up any new avenues. it's just taking up time in my life and making me exhausted cuz i have to be around people for like 5 hours each day.  it's so hard finding places there to be alone so that i can at least cry my feelings out a bit. they don't want you to 'isolate yourself'  so there are very few corners or places to hide, but i mean they also don't care about you soooooo???? i mean i get that yeah, they would care if they could it's just each coordinator has a lot of othher cases so they CAN'T be paying special attention to any of them and if i don't go to them for help or lie when some one asks \"are you okay?\", they can't know there's something wrong but it still boils down to they don't care and I don't trust them enough to talk to them because of the fact they don't care and feel lied to.  what's the point of being htere? at least when i'm at home i can sleep in bed all day and i can cry in my room by myself without being humilliated by people around me wathcing, and i can snuggle my cat, who DOES care about me. \ni'm angry because i went to a partial hospital program in january after being suicidal for a while and i'm so dumb because I actually came out feeling hopeful that things could be better and i feel like i was lied to. i'm sick of people only caring about that i'm alive physically. i don't feel alive mentally.  i have people that love me and care about me but at the same time,since they do love and care about me, they wouldn't want me to suffer anymore right? so even if I kill myself and they're said for a while, they should understand that it's ultimately okay because at least I'm not suffering anymore.  The weather is getting warmer which is really going to end up affecting my suicide plans because one of them is entirely dependent on the weather being freezing temperature and the other relies on people not being out and about too.   \nI'm just so angry and frustrated and depressed about how shitty everything is. I don't want o do this anymore. I think about having to live another 40+ years like this and it drives me up a fucking wall to think about. Even thinking about having to live another 5 years like this is maddening, I just can't do it.",

Thing is, I'm objectively well off. I have two understanding parents who very much want to see me get better, health insurance that let's me get affordable meds and regular therapy sessions if I so desire them, an \"okay\" track for the future (it's not great or anything, but I doubt I'll ever end up homeless or something like that), and so much more. I've got more things going for me than not, and yet I still make little to no improvement simply because I don't have the discipline necessary to make significant progress. I'm thoroughly aware of how much work it takes to get past depression, but knowing that just discourages me. I can't even apply myself enough to clean up my own fucking apartment regularly, and that's just the third step in the nigh limitless list of things I'll have to do to truly get better. My entire life is an monotonous story of dashed expectations, abandoned projects, and missed opportunities all completely owing to my own lack of conviction. I am being totally honest when I say that I have never once accomplished anything of note through raw determination. Everything of value that I've ever done has been the result of external forces coming together such that I never had a choice **but** to see the task to completion. That's never going to happen with fighting depression though, and I know that. I'm the deciding factor in whether my life gets better or not, but I'm also a lazy failure with no real achievements. Whenever I'm in a *mood* and see myself in the mirror I can't help but think: \"This is the guy who's supposed to reverse this whole trainwreck? Really?\" If I can't find the motivation to get better, why am I still wasting time and taking up resources while I pretend to try?

I'm 19 and I've been diagnosed with depression for 10 years. Yes, as stupid and odd as that sounds, I've been diagnosed since I was 9 and feeling this way even longer. I have been to four doctors in that time and none of them wanted to help me. The one I'm on now, number four, legitimately won't even try. I've done everything but jump on her desk and scream that I'm suicidal and willing to die or ready to start self medicating. I've been on every single medication there is, but she won't adjust the dosage of the medications that do need adjustment. Yes, my depression is treatment resistant, but that doesn't mean I should be kept on the same dose of Xanax I was on when I was 11 (I rarely used it until recently, it's not given me relief for years and I'll only taken it like twice a year until a few months ago). She won't listen when I said, before I was even using it regularly, that I get no help from it when I'm panicking. My panic is constant, even though on the outside I don't show anything anymore in terms of my everlasting terror.\nDoctor number four keeps trying to push TMS on me, but I don't trust it and I don't want to pay $700 in copays for something that makes me uncomfortable. She is legitimately trying to force me, and if I had any kind of confidence I might try raising some flags to the main person at the practice because she's not giving me any other options and she won't listen when I tell her that I will truly never ever want to try that or pay for it let alone commit the time to that. \nAnyway, nothing helps me. I'm always ready to break down and my sister constantly berates me. She's younger than I am, but she has more opportunities than I ever had... yet she makes fun of me because I've not gone to college when she knows full well that I cannot afford it and with my luck I'll never have any scholarship opportunites because there's always someone better than me. My father makes fun of me with her over everything, and my mom gets sick of me fast.\nThe only thing that makes me feel any better is temporary and ends fast but it's long drives to nowhere with MCR blasting in the car with the volume up almost all the way. As soon as I get home from escaping I sit and want to die again. LIke I'm willing myself to just disappear. There is nowhere that I'm safe and nobody I can talk to. It's been about six years since I last physically sliced into myself, and I feel worse than I did then. I feel numb in every sense of the word. When I'm not numb I'm on the verge of a break down.\nI don't sleep, I don't really eat, and I can't do anything worth my time. I don't have a job, I had to quit my most recent one thanks to a coworker repeatedly calling me retarded after me explicitly stating that I have Asperger's and she always blamed me for her mistakes (which does not turn out well when you're both pharmacy technicians and when she's the one that loses the fresh bottle of oxy and I got blamed, but she did get in trouble for that one and not me), when I mentioned it to HR I was told to suck it up and get over it. The other staff members did the same things to me when I only ever kept my head down and did my work, I only ever complained about the schedule because it was impeding my ability to go to the f***ing doctor. I was hired '減art time'?and scheduled six days a week, they tried to call me in on my one day off, and I was NOT allowed to be unavailable on days when I'll had something planned for over a year or had an appointment at a doctor's office. I can't get hired anywhere else because I live in the middle of nowhere and there aren't enough jobs so I don't get any calls for interviews. I see the same job I've applied for posted multiple times, even after I've applied for the position about 10 times and never even get an email telling me they aren't interested. The job before that had already started breaking me, but that one completely shattered the small amount of mental health I had left. \nI don't even dare ask doctor number four about disability because she doesn't even listen to a word I say. \nMy point is that I literally want to kill myself and get it over with. I've never been on a single date, I have no friends, and the only living being that actually cares about me is my dog and even then she's more than happy to spend time with the other members of my '渇amily'? \nI have no hope of ever finding someone to keep me in line or stop me from sinking further and further in to my terribly self destructive habits and I have nothing to bide my time with. \nIf there's a reason why I shouldn't just dig razor into myself somewhere I won't be found so I can die in peace I would love to know.",

At the beginning I was only taking one pill of Zoloft a day, but after a few months I didn't feel any improvements and was still as suicidal as I used to be. I thought the meds didn't work so I stopped using them for a while. Then things started going into a downward spiral from there. I stopped seeing shrinks and refused to meet any therapist because deep down inside of me I've always had this sense of distrust towards anyone beyond my closest circle. I've grown tired of telling them my stories over and over again. Two years from when I gave up on my meds my parents forced me to see another psychiatrist, and this time she simply suggested doubling my usage of Zoloft and I should see improvement in a few months'?time. I felt a little better during my first couple of weeks on added dosage, but after that I guess my brain has grown used to this extra input of sertraline so I gradually went back to my older pessimistic, suicidal self. I've had a couple of unsuccessful attempts at overdosing throughout the years, and now I'm prescribed to a laundry list of meds for depression, anxiety and sleeping problems.

I did my first semester almost fully last year, but dropped out of my second, which means that this year I only started at the second semester. \nLast year when i dropped out i pretty much *explicitely* told my parents i needed help (long story short: sent a message saying \"hi, i can't do school anymore, need to go home or i'm gonna hang myself\"). But what happened is that i just stayed home for almost a full year, barely getting any psychiatric help, although i knew i needed it.   \nAfter that year i went back to school kind of by default.

Spent a few months dealing with withdrawal then felt better than ever. Haven't self harmed in a year. Started enjoying and appreciating life again.

But dammit sometimes I wish I could. \nI feel like my sentences aren't making sense anymore. Please try not to make mean comments, I'm a bit fragile right now. God I sound like a pussy.

        "query": "First time I completely open up about my depression. Any advice or similar experiences are appreciated. : I remember being depressed for the longest time but I'd always been able to pull myself out of it and I never lasted long in that state but around a year ago I plunged into a depressive episode and I haven't been able to get out of it. I noticed that these short depressive phases I used to have were developing into something more when I completely lost all ability to feel any kind of emotion except anger and sadness. I became completely numb to everything and I couldn't feel anything for anyone in my life. I hate to say it but even my mother who means everything to me I stopped feeling love for. I started to drink a lot and I wouldnt be able to focus for more than 2 minutes at a time on something. I spent 90% of my time in class either asleep or watching shows. I couldn't study my grades were dropping and frankly I didn't care and I seriously considered dropping out of university. I cant even begin to explain to you how irritable I got I would get angry and annoyed at the smallest inconvenience in my life and everything would piss me off. One of my friends got in a really bad car crash and was paralyzed and the only thing I felt was annoyed because I had to take time out of my day to visit him in the hospital and the whole time in was there I was thinking about how much longer I had to pretend before I could leave. I was continuously pretending to feel happy joy excitement empathy at all times of the time because I knew those were the correct feelings I should have but I just didnt feel anything. Back in September I went to see a psychologist and she officially diagnosed me with depression but I only went to see her twice before I decided to stop going. I never tried to hurt myself but I would wake up every morning and wish I hadn't woken up. There was just one instance in January where I was driving on the highway at night I closed my eyes and let go of the steering wheel but only for a moment before I grabbed it again. I think that was when I knew I reached my lowest point. January I saw a psychiatrist and I started on Brintellix but I had to stop it 2 weeks later because I got really sick and I never went back to my psychiatrist so I could start on it again. When I was on it I dont know how it was possible but the second day after I started taking it I felt like myself again my body was literally tingling I felt surges of electricity and so much love for everyone and I was genuinely happy. After stopping it I can say I'm not as bad as I was before but I'm not good either. I still feel all those things but I am more able to study now and focus in classes. Yesterday I found out that my grandmother who I love so much most likely has cancer and has a surgery tomorrow and she might not make it. I feel terrible about saying this but when I heard the news I didnt feel upset I mainly felt annoyed that if something happens to her I'm going to have to miss out on a lot of classes so I can support my mom. I dont want to feel this way anymore I feel like a monster and I dont know how to get out of it. I feel like the longer this lasts the deeper I get into the hole and the less likely I am to get out if it. Or if I do get out of it it will be more likely that I will get back into it at the smallest inconvenience.  Am I ever going to feel like myself again? I just want to live a normal life without feeling like I'm one bad moment away from drowning",

        "query": "I'm not okay : Last year in late June 2019 I quit my first job out of college. I was there for less than a year since I graduated in May 2018. Before then I got an apartment in the city and I was excited to start my life. I worked as a paralegal because I was considering going to law school, then I saw firsthand how miserable the lives of attorneys are. I enjoyed the tasks but the work environment was so toxic. I grew more and more anxious and felt such a deep sadness that I didn't even know what brought me joy anymore. I quit in June and then started working as a real estate agent as I thought about what I wanted to do next. I figured if things went well enough in real estate, I could make a career out of it. Well, I live in a major city and competition is through the roof. No one in the office helps me or answers any of my questions. I've asked 3 agents out for coffee to hear their advice on the business and literally everyone has said this isn't a profession, it's all commission, it's too difficult, you're too young, etc etc. \nI look like a very calm, at peace individual, but inside I hold on to everything. I cry a lot at home. I force myself to still stay active, go out for social activities, and so forth, but nothing takes away this aching pain inside of me. I'm 23 years old and I feel so lost in life. I put a lot of blame on myself for majoring in journalism when I should have done something like engineering and actually get a livable and comfortable career out of it. Ever since I quit my job I've been living off of my savings and doing so is incredibly stressful. \nI always thought I knew what I wanted to do in life. I had such big dreams of working as a journalist only to work in the business while I was in school and discover it's not what I wanted at all but it was already too late. I graduated at the top of my class in university and I can't help but look at where I am now. Still relying on my mom to help me with rent even when I did have a job. She's in a great financial place to help me and encourages me consistently which I'm grateful for, but I don't want to have to rely on her financial help because I'm an adult and I should have this all figured out by now.\nI need to give an answer if I want to renew my apartment lease by April and I don't know what to do. If I don't have a job by then I won't be able to and will have to move out of the city back home, about 2 hours away, where jobs are even scarcer to find. \nI met a developer, investor, and realtor who owns his own small business in the city near my apartment and he's been almost like a mentor to him. I saw him yesterday and explained my situation to him. He told me that if I wanted to I could leave the current real estate company I'm at and go work for him and he would give me all of the rentals and sales his business has and walk me through the process. I told him I'm hesitant people even make a living from this because right now I'm at a luxury real estate company and clearly people are doing well yet they refuse to help. He said it's all about competition but at his business it's literally just him and one of his friends. He's already very established in life so he doesn't need the business, he just keeps this local real estate shop open to help out friends and family. I know he'll help me, but I'm worried about not having a stable/fixed income or a secure job. I found an opening for another paralegal position and think I might apply. The pay is a lot better than what I earned in my first job, and because this mentor lives so close to me perhaps I could work with him part time. He assured me I could make a full time salary with him, but because I'm so responsibility and security driven I worry about having a commission only income. \nEven if I do work as a paralegal again it's a job that leads to nothing. There's no growth within any company, you're just stuck there. And I absolutely do not want to go to law school. So here I am with no clue what in the world to do. \nI'm putting so much pressure on myself to have everything figured out. I've been stress eating a lot recently and that hasn't helped. I feel so down about myself and what my life has become. Rents in my city are outrageously expensive and to find roommates is a complete nightmare. Everything I love pays absolutely nothing. Being an adult has taught me that people work themselves to death doing something they hate 95% of the time. I don't know how I can live like that. Painting used to bring me so much joy and now I struggle with just being alive. I don't understand why people have children when life is this difficult. I feel so lost and I don't let myself just mourn this time of uncertainty because I can't, I need to get out there and be an adult and pay my bills and move on because life doesn't stop for anyone. I feel this heaviness inside and I don't know what to do.\nI've contacted 3 therapists and one took over two months to contact me, and the other one month, and the other I never heard back from. I hate the situation I'm in and as a proactive person I want to have my life figured out and the fact that it's in shambles is ruining me. \nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

        "query": "My story with medical gatekeeping and why American healthcare is a sick fucking joke : *From the top*,\nI have depression and PTSD. I've had the former all my life. I was diagnosed with the latter last year, but have probably had it for far longer. It only began to take over my life after I was raped in 2018. I have had to be sent to a mental hospital for med adjustments and suicide prevention on multiple occasions over the last 5 years. Until about 12 hours ago, I had been withdrawing from my antidepressants and hormone treatments. I had started withdrawing about 3 days prior. I spent those 3 days being shuffled around and gatekept by everyone with the authority to help me. Meanwhile, withdrawals and brain zaps were fracturing my brain and causing me to howl like an ape over the phone to my own mother. \nI was denied a refill of my antidepressants and hormone medication about a week and a half ago, around Valentine's Day. None of my medications realistically require regular checkups, but from what I understand this is legally required for all controlled substances, be they antidepressants or Adderall. So I told the pharmacy OK, order a new script. They told me no, talk to my doctor, they probably want to check on me before giving me a refill. Despite everyone's insistence that this happens regularly, I have never needed a checkup for antidepressants. I have not been examined for hormone treatments since 2018. They've just given me the fucking meds. In reality, unbeknownst to me, the practice the pharmacy was ordering these ghost meds from, which was the wrong practice and *not* my primary care, had silently closed their doors. No word of this at all to me. I wasn't informed of this until calling them today, over a week later. Meanwhile, I attempted to call my primary care, the real people writing my real prescriptions. The separate, now-closed practice wrote me a prescription once as a one-off thing, and that's why they were in the pharmacy's records at all. The latter practice was what my pharmacy requested my new prescription from. However, my primary care's voice menu, separate from the other, closed practice, was broken and hung up the call before I could even speak to anybody. In effect, they were hanging up on me. So I went back to my pharmacy and got a 3-day prescription to hold me over until I could get an appointment. The average psych schedules first-time appointments at least a week out, if you're lucky. I went through those meds in the blink of an eye. When I went back for another, I was informed that I could be given only one 3-day prescription regardless of how long I waited. \"Talk to your doctor.\" I told them I couldn't, because they were hanging up on me. There was no way they believed me. They just repeated themselves then sent me home without meds. This was around Friday, the 21st of February. I spent from then until Monday unable to contact anyone, and withdrawing from my meds. The pharmacy was just totally down to let me do that, I guess. Meanwhile, the original request they had made to the closed practice was just floating in the ether, being faxed to no one. At this point, the denial was four-fold: my primary care was giving me the cold shoulder, the pharmacy was refusing my meds, the practice I called for backup just up and vanished, and my new insurance hadn't been updated in pharmacy records yet. No one was explaining to me why now, of all times, my meds were being taken away. As an extra layer, my family had changed insurance in 2020, so no prescriptions written could even be paid for until I eventually had that updated. None of this was communicated directly to me. I toughed it out and spent Friday-Monday withdrawing from all of my meds, then went back to the pharmacy on Monday to explain my situation. I was told again to talk to my doctor. I explained that I couldn't, because they were hanging up the phone on me. The pharmacy insisted they could not help me. I wasn't sure what else to do at this point, so I had my best friend take me to urgent care that night for emergency Rx. Withdrawals and brain zaps were making it hard to walk and talk, so my body was only letting me sleep from early morning to late afternoon, and urgent care was the only place that was open besides the literal hospital. Despite this, urgent care insisted that they were unable to write prescriptions for antidepressants, and redirected me to the ER. So my friend drove me to the ER. While we were in line, we got a front row seat to about 8 cops tackling and arresting a rowdy kid in a wheelchair. After about an hour in the lobby, I was called to the back. I was then made to wait in an ER bed for about 3 hours. I got a nap out of the whole thing, at least, as well as a request for 30 days of meds from an RN. Hell yeah! All I had to do was pee in a cup, because Lord knows I coulda been doping on that desvenlafaxine! That was worth me giving them an unmarked, untraceable bottle of my pee that they now just kinda have My mother insisted to me, whilst I was losing my shit over the phone, that this was the fault of the opioid crisis, and not that of the moronic bureaucrats that created it. I love my mama, but she lives in this weird quantum state where she is simultaneously saving my life and lecturing me about why all of my feelings are wrong. I dunno. Mothers. So long story short, I got to go home from the ER with an alleged prescription in my name for 30 days of meds. Great. I went the next day, Tuesday, to my pharmacy to pick it up. I was told that the original request was still pending and to talk to my doctor. It was only *then* that I was informed that the lost request was going to the closed practice, and it was only then that I called the now-closed practice as backup to discover that they were even closed at all. I went back to the ER to see what the deal was and ask for a paper copy of my prescription, on authority from my mom, who is very experienced with bureaucracy. After another 20 minutes in line, I got to ask for a paper copy. After another few minutes in the lobby, an RN pulled me aside and found the log of the prescription from Sunday night. I wasn't permitted to leave with a paper request, so the guy called the pharmacy I had just left. The pharmacist there found a prescription under my current legal name and the meds were apparently waiting for me this whole time. That wasn't what I was told! So I went back to the pharmacy one last time, asking what the deal was. It was then that I had found out that the pharmacy had not yet updated my last name, because my old last name wasn't updated for whatever reason on my insurance card from 2019. Mind you, I had my new insurance card in my wallet with my current full name on it, and I didn't know where or with whom to udpate this information, so requests were being made by like 5 different people under 5 different names for the same 3 meds. None of these requests have gone through yet. This much was all figured out between myself, my mother, and pharmacy staff over about an hour long conversation. It was only then that I had my name and insurance properly updated for both the hospital and the pharmacy, and it was only then that insurance would pay for the prescription from the ER, which they could now finally see. Once that was all said and done, I still had to pay 20% on my parents' HSA card. I tore open the packaging in front of the lady as quickly as my shaky hands would allow and gobbled the pills down right there. And I ate ice cream cause I fucking earned it.\nI asked my mom why it took this much. She told me \"give it a few days to figure it out\". I could tell she was trying to tell me, diplomatically, that I'll realize in time that this was my fault. This is what happens when I try to have a backbone about fucking anything. What was the point to going to all this therapy to improve my self-esteem if it's so fucking scandalous to everyone around me the moment I do? Why am I the asshole for wanting meds as soon as I need them? It's not personal, I just want my brain to fucking work. Sure, hindsight's 20/20 and if I could navigate bureaucracy flawlessly, then yeah, maybe I could've had meds before I ran out. But I didn't because I'm 23 and no one taught me this shit. Why is that my fault and why do I have to suffer for it? I'm not even sad anymore I'm just fucking furious that this is what I have to deal with. But apparently I was supposed to just take all that shit lying down and say thank you for dessert. Why is everyone so dead set on shoving trans women into a grave, huh?",

I still feel like having my ex back would make me feel validated and loved, hoping it would kick start my life but I know now she won't ever come back because good things don't happen to me and even if they do I'd ruin them. \nMy mood swings are crazy, I'm so irratable I hate it, I have random moments where ill sob for 20 mins straight just because I miss her and just want the happiest moments of my life back, even though I ruined it for myself and I'm just angry at eveeything. I live with regret everyday with a large side of guilt, I can't move on from her because I just don't feel worthy of anyone so I keep myself hidden away and avoid people in general. I'm disliking a whole gender because of a few girls who have broken me. \nSomething is seriously wrong with me besides depression, I don't feel in control, I don't have a grip on myself, I don't know if my emotions and feelings are true or if I can trust myself or not. My mind body and soul aren't in sync. I feel any normal person would've got out of this and found a job atleast but I haven't had a proper job since 2016 and I'll be 25 this year. My grandma is on he rlast legs and my dad can't go see her because we can't pay the mortgage for the time hell be gone. If I wasn't this depressed and suicidal over my ex leaving me I'd be able to help him out and go see my grandma.\nPeople keep saying I need to do things for myself but I can't, I hate myself now a lot, wto apojt where I've stopped caring about my appesrence or hygiene in general I've given up. I never thought my future would be this but then again I didn't actually have a plan for the future so I guess I can't complain. All is my fault and if I want to get better I have to do it myself no one can live my life for me. After all the debate in my head I always come to the conclusion of death. It's so sad that life has become so unlikeable that death actually excites me. I wouldn't harm myself because I'm a coward, but I'd be happy to hear I have a limited time left here.\nI've played enough and maybe I haven't tried as hard as everyone else but I see this as natural selection, I don't have it in me to fight, I don't want to pass on my weak genes. I envy those who have stable minds and can do things just because they have to. Most likely I'm just super lazy and stubborn but Id rather die than to fight to live in a world where there's lots of people but not enough humans.\nThe solution to my problem may seem very obvious to some of you and that's awesome but I have zero reason to live or lack of will to live. Zero ambitions zero dreams. I just feel like if I could get my ex back then I'd be happy again and I'd feel good about myself. Automatically your brain will say no that's toxic and not how it should be  but how do I explain that its how I feel inside and can't budge from it and how low it makes me feel when I think of her. I'veost my identity and truly feel like I can't make it through life alone and without her. I smoke in the hopes of getting cancer and then I can finally be free from this suffering, wish me luck.

I cried for the first time a week or so ago since 2012, for pretty much no reason. I was sitting on my couch, knew I couldn't just \"be alone\", and called up a friend, and just immediately tears started streaming down my face.

I was laid off in 2009 from a great paying job that I loved never had another job since. I still had a good side business but that eventually went under in 2012. After trying to find work without much success I lost all motivation and gave up. After my money ran out I have been surviving by the grace of family with some money coming in here and there from real estate. While I once had a beautiful house I lost I now live in my deceased grandmothers house in a lower income area, while I am thankful I have a roof over my head the run down neighborhood adds to my depression. \nI have had a wonderful relationship for 5+ years that ended 3 months ago because of my depression. She was so supportive and tried so hard to get me motivated to get help but I always refused. She wanted to get married but I always had a dumb excuse why I couldn't. After 5 years of trying to fix me and my unwillingness to get married she said she needed to move on. I know if I showed any interest we would have stayed together but my twisted mind thought if I can't give her the happiness she wants let her go find it...and she did. I took her for granted and thought I could just continue without her but I was wrong. \nOver the years I have alienated all my friends from not showing up or talking to them, damaged close family relationships because of my depression and not realizing it threw away the only good thing I had in my life. We truly loved each other but the depression became too much for me to over come. I would give anything to have her back as I now realize how important she was to me and how much I truly loved her. She was the one thing that kept me going on even through the depression. Now without her my life is empty, meaningless and has no worth. It feels like the final straw.\nAs depressed as I have been I never had serious suicidal thoughts much until now. I no longer see a future or light at the end of the tunnel. At 53 the chances of meeting someone again in my situation is next to impossible. I just feel so alone without her. She was everything to me and it hurts that much more that the only reason she is gone is because I couldn't find the strength to try. \nI am still trying to fight but hope is fading. All I see is a lonely miserable future from here on out and  I can't go on with this pain anymore. The only thing stopping me is the devastation it will cause to my mother and daughter. I don't know where I am going with this other than I need to vent. I would never talk to somebody about the seriousness of my intention to kill myself. It is just so hard to try and continue to live. I threw away the last good thing I had in my life.",

I've gotten fired repeatedly because I'm too \"weird\" for retail, but that is the ONLY job that exists in the United States now that does not require either a full time schedule or like 4 college degrees and a multitude of skills I don't have. I am flunking out of classes because I'm lonely and depressed as all hell. I have seen tens of therapists and cannot be helped by a single one. It's a back and fourth with me and other people, where I am constantly told I need help. THEN, after all of this, I finally decide \"ok, I gave it my best and society/life and the world are rejecting my existence, I should just leave this place\" I get put in a fucking hospital where someone throws up on me and I hear screaming sounds all night and I'm not allowed to leave because I'm so panicked that I don't fall asleep, but then they force some powerful drug up my ass and then I have to fight falling asleep because every time I do I hallucinate shit and panic, then they give me medication after medication until I fucking collapse and I feel like shit for days. I will never tell anyone I need mental help again, because every time I do I suffer for it.\nIn my view, these are basic needs and easy to meet. I just want to love someone and have a house.

Me functioning as I do and the lack of visible damage has always led me to thread this line of where I am not sure if I'm making all of this up or if it's real, which could also be a whole other post ha.\nBut the thing I wanted to ask, just to find someone who feels like this, is anyone just empty? Like, I joined the gym last summer after around 8 years of wanting to go, but my anxiety being a huge roadblock. I am planning a pilgrimage and hike a lot as it is. I study to get good grades and so on, my point being I seemingly have goals and ambition. But I just feel like a void. I see no point in anything life offers. When I set my mind for something I just wait for it to be completed and then I move on, almost completely dissociating from this thing, no matter how joyful it was. I feel detached from the world, I zone out a lot. I feel nothing I do during the day is a valid justification for me to be alive, like I am wasting time and space.\nI'm not looking for sympathies or anything, I just felt like writing this to see if someone can relate. There were so many times I was so much worse and writing smth like this could have maybe helped, but writing calmly like this now makes me feel I won't just delete this in 10 minutes. Just posting this is out of my comfort zone, but fuck it. \nPS; I am seeing a psychologist, I was seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication for a while but stopped '榗ause it made things worse. And I understand why everything is happening and how it is linked (as much as one can). It's just that in spite all of this it's like i just don't care, all is irrelevant. And in that irrelevance I still try and do, just in ways to diminish my existence.",

Faculty just think I should work harder or tell me to nut up or are close to her. I wouldn't have anything to speak to with others even if I could; I have little in common with anyone in this place. Tried therapy... tried exercise... tried relaxing. Actually they do work, but I just can't stay consistently doing any of them for very long until another health problem or some fucking college family bullshit comes up. I have ADD too, so hahahah doing anything that requires discipline.\nWhen I graduate I will have spent 8 goddamn years of life in this institution, if I never have to study for another fucking exam again it'll still be too soon. Teachers have interminable classes and drone on and have their material scattered all over the place, making everything difficult, and then blame me when I do poorly. Yeah yeah work is worse, blah blah. That's not motivating me. My goals drift away while all this abuse continues. The worst is trying to put on a mask for other people and pretend like I'm not depressed because mother dearest bitches at me or acts sad if I try to indulge in 'the basic pleasure of openly hating \\[my\\] life,' as that one youtuber put it. \nThe only consolation is that I'm one of those insane child prodigies that entered the system years early, so I haven't lost that much time. It probably did more harm than good, in the end. I have two rotten molars that have been that way for almost a decade and a left ear that's had some kind of issue for a few months and anytime I bring this up she meanders and finds some way to put it off. But she hangs on every teacher's every word. Sick of her shit. Sick of being shoved around, and sick of my only outlets being games, jerking off and reading terrible people's terrible opinions online. I tried writing a short story; I even finished it, submitted it, got rejected narrowly. My motivation to work after that went to zero; just starting to rebuild it now.\nSometimes I find comfort and something like thrill in fun media, good food or evenhobbies, but it doesn't last long because that's how the human mind works. What my mother's doing is probably illegal, but I have no way of proving she doesn't let me out of the house (physically blocked my way once and took my phone), and if I tried to talk to someone beside my therapist, in meatspace, about my abuse they'd probably think I mean physical abuse. I have OCD as well, because fuck me, and I treat every manmade surface as potentially contaminated which means I can't eat out properly anyhow. \nAll these issues have been there for years, but it's only last year I realized my mother was abusive and it's only in the past few months that it's gotten truly grave. I tried as hard as I could to study and keep up but it just wasn't enough and I got another kick in the shins when the teacher said my assignments -- the ones I worked so long on -- were worth a small portion of the final grade. I've finally had enough, and I'm starting to disengage from reality. \nThe thing I look forward to most at this point is sleeping; my dreams can be terrifying or tense, but at least the constant background of pain and low-level self-hatred isn't there. I'm tired of being a self-contradictory mess ideologically, I'm tired of my past mistakes, and I'm most of all tired of trying to climb out of the pit just to have my hands slashed. If there were an easy and convenient method of suicide -- like a fast-working poison -- available to me, I would likely have taken it. Easier than trying and failing to get better for the next forty or fifty years. There. That's my rant.",

I feel no satisfaction or pleasure in life although I am still able to work, have social interactions and lead an apparent normal life. Even the things I always liked such as play bass, sing, video games or reading give me no satisfaction. I still do these things but in 'auto mode'. Besides the lack of satisfaction, I feel enraged. All the time. Everything pisses me of literally. This is going now for a year or so, I think. \nI went to a psychologist for the first time last week and since it was my first appointment, nothing was done. We just talked and I didn't know that there was this condition then. I just told her that I feel my life lost its meaning.  So next week I tell her about this Dysthymia thing and hear what she has to say.\nWhat bothers me the most is that this is really not helping my relationship. I live with my SO for four years now and she is also struggling with depression. She has the 'classic' depression: sadness, anxiety and some episodes of panic attack but she is seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist for some time and undergoing treatment. However, if she had emotional support from her SO, things would be much better for her, I believe. I don't feel like being around her anymore. We occasionally watch something together or play some board games (I am always in auto mode when doing these things) but that is all. We do not talk much as before and it's been two months since we had sex, and I feel absolutely nothing about this.  I really don't care.\nToday things got worse. We argued when she said I don't give her attention. She is right about this. However, I am simply not able to give her attention or love. I wanted to show her love but I can't. If I did it would be fake. It would be in 'auto mode' and I don't believe this would help. I am really dead on the inside. I just told her I feel nothing for her and I am not feeling sad about this nor angry, nothing. She is devastated but said she prefer to hear the truth.\nI almost left home but she convinced me to stay. Told her to go look for someone else who could actually give her some emotional support. She said that she cannot do that. It would be wrong to leave me when I also need help and she stills loves me.\nThis can't continue. I must try to do something. I want to feel alive again.

Some backstory to my questions:\nI went through counseling with a therapist two years ago, for an overall period of about a year. I had weekly sessions to start and trailed down to once a month once I was feeling able to manage my thoughts a bit better. I stopped going when I felt like it was no longer beneficial and that I didn't get enough out of the sessions. I did actually enjoy seeing this therapist (unlike a previous one years ago). \nIn the last session we spoke about potential next steps, and I mentioned that I would be willing to try medicine to try to even out my mood. My therapist said that medicine can work for some people and not for others. He recommended a nearby '減rescriber'? basically a psychiatrist instead of a therapist. Some therapy is still involved but less frequently, and more as a quick check than a full session (those are shorter as time goes on). He cautioned that they generally don't accept insurance and can be very expensive. \nI'm experiencing symptoms of depression again, and in the back of my mind I know I need help. There are some persistent thoughts that I haven't been able to shake in addition to general feelings that I can feel aren't really me. \nHas anybody had experiences seeing a prescriber or psychiatrist specifically for medicine in order to try resolving their symptoms? It feels odd to seek out a doctor in order to try medicine, but I guess that's what we all do when we're sick. Please let me know if it was beneficial to you, if you learned anything useful, or even if it wasn't for you and why. \nI know it's time to get help but I also feel that it may be time to try something different.

My mother was incapable of looking after any of us and we were put up for adoption. I was placed into a house where both parents hated one another and divorced one month after I arrived. I stayed in that house for 8 years, and in 2017 I left because I was being abused and treated like an object.

I did all the household chores, cooked, cleaned... I had no time to socialize which has come back and bit me in the ass now. I attempted to kill myself while I was there, but failed. I didn't have any friends, so no one could comfort me when I was feeling like shit. Whenever I was at school, I was the weird kid; always alone, talked to myself (probably insanity), and somewhat schizophrenic. I never felt safe anywhere, and as a result I can't trust anyone now. When I moved schools in 2017, I was partially excited because no one liked me in my previous school. But it is so much worse.

I finally had a job and was just using my money to buy weed and real versions of toys that would fall apart from the dollar store but that's beside the point. The weed helped mellow me out alot. It's been 6-7 years now. I spend like $70 every few days. When I dont have it I become irritable, argumentative and just down right mean. Once I finally come down fully I just dont feel much. I just kind of run through the motions with my negative self talk. Then I turn. Talking too much about nothing to the point of arguing because I just want to connect with someone on anything. Hot flashes on my upper body and chills on my spine cold enough I have to shake it off after. Drooling uncontrollably. extreme self seclusion because I dont know how to act in public beyond trying not to cause issues or fights. I just dont cope beyond avoidance of the situation entirely. And to be honest I suspect I might be on the spectrum when it comes to some of my behavior but it could also be my childhood abuse doing weird things to my brain. I dont know.\nBut once I have the weed. I feel like a sharp ball of nails melting into a passive ball of just not caring. But with the less I care about my anxiety and depression the less I care about anything else and end up barely getting anything done. My parents hate the smell and that I spend so much on it. I have to get it through my little (16) brother so I'm also burdening every few days. And to top it all off I've never seen a doctor for anything mentally related so I'm just kind of in the wind on this. I hate coming down and all the sneaking to get it. But I also don't want to be on medications so I don't really know what to do except keep smoking.",

I lived in a good city, got my bachelor麓s degree and could just do 1 more year of part-time studying to get a job with a good wage. Had a girlfriend, lived together, I went to the gym almost every day and I felt great about myself.\nThen I decided to move to the U.K for a year to do a master麓s degree in something that I may or may not get a job within back in my home-country. Mind you that I already had a student loan of $45 k, now I borrowed an additional $35 k to come here. For what? I麓m a supporter of the football team that resides here, I麓ve followed them since I was a kid. Relationship was a bit unstable at the time so my best response was to flee (breakup was not bad at all, still friends). Now I麓m sitting in my ridiculously small, crazy expensive student麓s accommodation, I live with 4 people who are 6-7 years younger than me, all my friends from uni are working all the time and the course I麓m doing is not at all what I thought it would be (I only have a few months left and my master麓s dissertation that I may be able to do from home). I regret coming here, my social life is a mess and I miss my friends and family back home (everything about my home country really).\nI麓ve suffered depressions before due to illness in the family as well as bullying when I was a kid, but I thought I was done with this. I had worked myself up to a respectable social life, lots of friends. I had shed my excess weight, I looked good and felt good. Now I will sit in my room and procrastinate, eating the cheap candy they sell here (I come from a very expensive country), playing videogames. I finish all of my assignments at the last second. I麓m constantly thinking about going home but with the financial commitment I麓ve made to come here, it would kill my parents (or rather, they would kill me). I don麓t know what to do. I feel the relapse coming, all my negative thoughts about myself are constantly weighing me down and it has made me a lazy slob. The first thing people said when I went home for christmas was that I had put on weight. And how right they are.\nI just needed to vent my thoughts, don麓t expect all the response in the world, but any advice would be appreciated. Have a lovely day.\nTl;dr : My life was wonderful, I moved abroad and I feel like my depressions are returning because I think I made the wrong choice.",

Cool. After a series of hoops and headaches I get an appointment. Changed my work schedule so I could make it because there wasn't a promise I would be able to reschedule soon. Came into my job at 5:45am so I could get there on time without losing hours at work. \nMy appointment was supposed to be with a woman...but apparently that was changed without notifying me. I DEFINITELY would've cancelled in that case but whatever, I was already there. Get in this dudes office and he immediately tells me that I have PTSD. That the depression is just a symptom of that. I'm like ???? He says these are the types of things people with PTSD usually experience. I tell him I don't really experience that. He goes on about PTSD. I ask, so did my original provider send something over that makes you say that? He said no, they didnt send over anything related to my care. Keeps talking about PTSD. Says he sees lots of people with it and he's ex military so he knows (but I've never been seen by you before???)\nThen he says he's not really into medication (????) Says he believes in holistic approaches like herbs, acupuncture and the whatnot w a combination of therapy. Says he will refer me to therapist intake. I was clear that I wanted to go the medication route and wasn't interested in \"herbs\". He says well if you're sure we can do a swab test and maybe start you on a small dose of zoloft but other things would be better. I said I'd take the swab. So he says sure, but I'll also put you down for therapist intake (???)\nSo I leave and he gives his instructions to the nurse. Once he's gone I tell her 1) Under no circumstances do I want to be seen by him again 2) I said I didn't want a therapist intake there and 3) Just please give me a prescription so I can go. So she says sure...then sends my prescription to a walgreens to be filled. I leave...head to the Walgreens...and the pharmacist goes...Didnt they tell you? We dont accept your insurance. You have to have this filled with your original provider. \n...No, no one told me that. It's after 5pm. I call them and they are closed. He says you can still pick this up, but you have to pay out of pocket. I call my original provider and they're like, well yeah obviously we have to write your prescription and fill it (then what was I referred for???????). I asked if they knew the \"doctor\" they had me see was selling herbalife and snake oil on the side. They said they go through a third-party for referrals, there's a lot of doctors in the system. \nAt this point I'm standing in the middle of a Walgreens near tears. Not depression tears mind you, rage tears. I just paid for it out of pocket because I wanted to go home. Oh and by the way my insurance won't reimburse me. Because according to them someone should've known where to send the Rx. So fuck me I guess.  But I can't take it because I'm definitely not going back to that place to have it refilled and I need SOMEONE to tell me why I can't just been seen by my original provider. This has been such bullshit. I feel like I would've just been better off coming home from work and going to sleep like I always do.\nLike what is the point of making this shit as hard as fucking possible??? WHAT IS THE POINT",

I can't cry, I don't laugh, I'm just numb.  Then there are days like this where I feel everything at once, yet I still feel silenced by it all. The feeling of being suffocated by deep sadness. It's as though everything has no purpose and I can't find myself to accomplish anything. You know deep down you mean so much to so many people but it's clouded by the thoughts. Nothing seems logical. It's days like these where I feel restrained by my own self and yet again I let another day go to waste. I don't eat, I didn't shower or brush my teeth, my hair is in the same bun I put it in before I went to sleep last night. There is nothing worse in this world than being stuck in your own head. You're told it can go away but it hasn't. It's a constant battle within yourself. After you get over the mountain of depression, you hate yourself even more for not being able to control it sooner. You don't know how to ask for help because no one really understands how you feel. So you suffer in silence over and over again. This is my problem that I should be able to take control of, but I can't and I haven't so I continue to live through it time after time. You stop answering texts and calls, you cancel plans and no one knows it's because of how depressed you are. You come up with excuse after excuse on why you can't make it. I know I need help but what is a therapist going to say differently this time? The thought of driving over to talk and feel the exact same leaves me even more hopeless. Calling the doctor to change my medication because it's not working is a big task that I don't want to go through - driving to her, trying a new medication, experiencing new side effects, spending more money that I don't have because I call out of work so often since I can't get out of bed. I feel defeated and mentally exhausted. Some nights I'm awake, tossing and turning, hoping I'll be able to put my mind at ease but I end up suffering from insomnia. When I finally do sleep, I wake up late and am disappointed with myself for sleeping and wasting half my day that could have been used to pick up the slack from the previous days when I was paralyzed from depression. Other nights I sleep 12+ hours. It's like I can't win. How are you supposed to feel when depression is taking over your life? You're close to losing your job, your grades are terrible, you physically don't take care of yourself anymore. Not to mention all the things you used to love to do, you can't find the energy or passion anymore. This is when you start to fantasize about death. It just seems so promising. No more suffering. You can finally escape the constant sadness. Is there really a better answer? Will I ever understand what true happiness feels like? People tell you there is hell out there but it's only temporary. The vicious cycle seems to pick right back up, especially when you least expect it. Doesn't matter where you are, all you want to do is go right back in your bed, alone, away from everyone and everything - isolated one your own sadness. As I write this, I realize I need help and I want help but I've done it all before yet I'm still here, worse than I was before. It's like depression evolves as time goes on and one day it will be too much to handle. That's when you know you can't fight anymore.",

But for the last few days depression is back with no explanation at all. I know something is terribly wrong with me but I don't have a clue why. Was it the show I was watching that was a little disappointing or the stress of my rent going up? I have Bipolar2 so I shouldn't be shocked I guess but it's been so well in control for so long because my kids are great and my love for them brings happiness. These last days though I can't get myself into mommy mode at all. I feel devastated, like there is no future to look forward to, and that I wish I could tun off my brain and wake up next to one of my old friends that ditched me a while ago who I used to tell everything to....I'm pathetic I know. Maybe that's ok but it hurts.",

        "query": "listened into my moms convo with my lazy brother and now I'm somehow lower than I was before : I'm too tired to write out my whole backstory but long story short I've had bad depression since I was 12 (20 now), I'm really good at hiding and bottling up my emotions so mom doesn't notice most of the time. I told her a few years ago that the incidents of my middle school haunt me everyday and that I have depression. \nShe put me up on some vitamins and told me I need to exercise more. \nI've only seemed to get worse as the years have gone on. I used to be able to work through it and keep going with it just on the back burner until I was alone in bed at night with my brain. \nNowadays, I'm unfocused. I'll lay down for bed and realise I don't remember my full day of work and school. Today I woke up and realised I forgot to shower for an entire week. I'm spiralling really bad and so this past Monday I asked my mom if I could get professional help. \nWe talked for a long time and we set me up with a therapist that I'll start seeing within the next month. I've never gotten professional help or medicine for that matter the entire time I've been going through this. \nAnyway, I've ranted a bit too much. Basically, about an hour ago, I heard my brother (25, unemployed, cliche lazy guy who plays games all day) complaining about having to start work for the first time in months soon. \nMom went off on a tangent about how his laziness has led him into this '渇unk'?and how he won't be able to handle the hard work of his upcoming job bc he's gotten so used to laying around all day. \nThen, I hear my name. She starts to say that the reason he and I are having mental problems is because we both didn't have jobs during last semester and got so used to gaming everyday. (Which is only half true. I play games when I can, but I've fallen off of it more and more lately, as I have most things I was interested in) \nShe said lots of more shit, basically putting us in the same boat. Talking about how laziness is bc '渢his generation gets too comfortable'?or whatever. \nBasically she just called us both lazy and blamed our '渇unks'?on this laziness. \nI took pretty bad offence to it, as I am quite the opposite of lazy. Even when I was unemployed last semester, I was still physically active, and I spent a lot of time doing chores around the house or homework when I wasn't at school. \nMy brother, on the other hand, will come in once a week with a huge ass pile of dishes from his room and dump them in the sink for someone else to do. He wakes up at 3pm everyday. \nI should add, he doesn't have any mental issues. He got into a lot of trouble fighting ppl in high school and he had to drop out and get his GED. There's nothing mentally or physically wrong with him, he's just extremely lazy and gets mad defensive if you try to ask him why he spent all week in bed and didn't at least make more tea when he drinks the last bit, ya know?\nLook, I don't despise him. I've accepted that he's that way, even if it's badly detrimental to his future. I stopped caring so much and just focused on my own goals. \nBut ever since I heard my mom throw me in with that, I've started to realise that that's probably why she never got me professional help all these years for my depression. She just thinks I'm lazy. \nI've gotten so much worse lately and I haven't cut since I was 16 but I found myself scratching at my arm until it bled and now I've started scratching at it when I find myself falling too deep. \nToday at work I realised I'll just been staring at the table below me for an hour straight and didn't do a single thing. \nI dont know, it's fucked. I haven't acted on my suicidal thoughts since I nearly attempted at 14 (mom doesn't know about that one) and despite telling my mom this week literally exactly '渉ey, I don't think I will live much longer if I don't get some serious help'? she still thinks it's just some damn lazy crap because I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. \nShe's never had real depression so she doesn't get how hard it is to do the simplest of things. \nIf anyone's read this far, really what I'm looking for is just some basic advice on how to get going without anyone around you believing what you have is real. \nI didn't mean for this to turn into a rant. I've just been trying my hardest to be proud of myself for forcing myself out of bed everyday to go to work and school and it feels like she just shit on that, especially when she's saying this when she thinks I can't hear. \nI dont know. I'm sorry.",

        "query": "I don't know what to do. : Hey um, good morning, my name is Kevin. Just, straight up, I feel like I have no direction in life. Abruptly, I'd like to begin by saying that I have been diagnosed, by a professional, with Major Depressive Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and that my family has a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, mental health issues and suicide and before going any further, I want to make it known that I do not have any suicidal thoughts or intentions to act on any thoughts of the sort. With that said, here's a bit of background to better help understand my situation. I live with my mother and my sister, I'm 20 years old, I graduated from high school 2 years ago and went right into college and 2 terms in, right out into the real world not having pulled through with my education. All of my education (just public school, I don't know anything about private schooling and therefore none of what I'm going to say applies to any form of private schooling) from elementary through to the very last day of high school was absolutely horrible, I had no friends, I was constantly in-between being baker acted, put on suicide watch and coming back to school two weeks later and doing jack s\\*\\*t at school, whether it'd be because I lacked motivation, because the teachers were incompetent, immature, perverted, inconsiderate, irresponsible, ignorant, entitled grown a\\*\\* adults (some were an exception) or because I didn't feel like I would amount to anything later in life or because my arthritis was acting up and my hands just couldn't write anymore or because insomnia or just because I was more concerned with making friends and not being alone in the world and in the end the only friends I made were the psychologist and psychiatrist that took my insurance and much more importantly my best friend who's like a brother to me now. I got to college and I was still an emotional kid but I was motivated to move forward with my education expecting college professors to be much better than the high school teacher whose life didn't turn out the way they wanted and to say the least, the professors weren't much of an improvement, so I got mad, I felt cheated and I left to take a break from school, to regather myself so that I could pull through and get my degree and move on and then my funding was cut because I had dropped my last classes of that last term I went through and that's 100 and 10 percent my fault. I shouldn't have let my emotions control my actions because at the end of the day I did what I needed to do to get to college and the degree is mine not theirs but I didn't think of that then and what happened, happened and all I could do is move forward. So I got a job in order to save up money to get back to my education and I quit because I didn't feel that I needed to be taken advantage of the way I was at work, I worked 45+ hours a week for $9.35/hr as a \"Part-Time\" employee, I was offered a promotion as manager and I took it and training for the new position began and after a while I realized that I was just being used as a manager without manager pay, I had already been \"training\" a while and no word of my promotion was mentioned and when I asked I was met with, basically, \"Who tf do you think you are?\" So I left looking for a better job because I know that I was worth more. I put up my two weeks notice and started looking for another job, that was almost a month ago, I haven't found anything and I ended up not saving any money because I had to help my mom pay bills and I have my own responsibilities as well, such as my cat and my car and my phone and my food and hygiene and clothing, so on and so forth. Now I'm an unemployed, irresponsible, childish, completely dependent, college drop-out with no one other than my mom to fully rely on. I've been applying to everywhere and now my mom has a new job with better benefits and better coworkers but she doesn't make a dollar more than I used too at my old job and we're just struggling to get f\\*\\*\\*ing chicken tenders for dinner without sacrificing gas money or internet or rent or electricity or water. I'm overwhelmed and sad and I did this to myself,  I honestly did. Everything that has lead me here was my own doing, that's how it feels and I know the obvious step forward is to get a job, my only problem is how I'll get back to school. With what money? With what time? I can't help thinking how stupid I've been.",

She said something along the lines of \"but he's his own entity, and you're your're own entity. You can be there for each other, but you have to be there for yourself.\". She knows I didn't have that growing up. Nobody was ever there for me really so how the he'll am I supposed to do it now? I guess we'll be working on that in the future. But after I got home and though about it for a bit I'm thinking I don't want to. Why should I have to take responsibility for myself, when I never asked to be born? I never wanted to be here. And knowing that society is asking me to be here and to cope with being mentally ill, and to do all this work I never signed up for is what's making me depressed I think. I would really rather die than do all this hard work that was just thrust upon me without my consent. I feel like no matter how much of this shit taht I sift through I will always feel the same about it. I just started taking wellbutrin a couple of weeks ago and idk if it's going to help me or not, but I certainly don't feel like therapy is very helpful because I DON'T WANT to do it. I don't want to do the work. I want to feel better, sure. But in the context I feel like it would be easier to escape, as I often do. Into novels, into games, into my art. But reality sucks and I hate it and nothing anyone says or does is going to make that change and I just wish she would agree with me that life is indeed unfair and unjust and I shouldn't have to be held to society's ridiculously high standars of what a person should be. I don't want to do stressfull things anymore. I just want to be happy. I just want someone to ask me what I need and take care of me for once.",

Kind of ranting about life right now. Past 3 years have been terrible. Life in general has been cruel. I'm a 21F, going through a series of changes for the past month. \nWe'll just get this life rant over with:\nFather: An actual pedo,. Not only did he perform, have me perform and try to have intercourse with his 3-13 yr old daughter ( it's my earliest memory and went on continuously for at the very least 10 yrs) but he also took pictures of me, showed me child porn and had me talk \" dirty to him\". Also an alcoholic who cheated on my mother multiple times, hid money from us in financial struggles, verbally abused my mother and at one point held a gun to her head as I watched and called the cops( 14yrs old).\nMother: knows about pedo father, literally said \"he never did any of that with me\" as if she were jealous, used me as a confident, verbally abused me, physically abused me ( threw me into walls, held me down and spit on my face, hit me where my nose would bleed, kick me in the head while I was on the groud), mostly when I tried to do anything a normal kid/teen would do like go out with friends. Still with my father today knowing what happened and everything he has done to our \"family\". I went to the police when I was 17yrs old because I had physical hand Mark's around my neck and they literally drove me home.\nYounger Brother: four years younger. we fought like most siblings but we were there for each other no matter what. I would do anything for him and stand up for him when other kids bullied him. I wanted to adopt him and take him away form that house hold so he could have a better life then I. From all I know he received some physical abuse but not nearly as bad as I. He killed himself when he was 16yrs old (more than a year ago) 6 months before I came home from the military. I miss him every friggin day. I feel as though I abandoned him when I joined the service when I was 18.\nOutside family: in there own little worlds. At one point each one of them has expressed their concerns with the household but none of them helped. None of them. But they can all talk/ gossip about it amongst themselves.\nMy military service was short cut. Due to alot of issues I ran into with drinking, tattoo policies, not able to form bonds with others, forming bonds with the wrong people, annd anxiety and depression being the end to it. Got out as General under honorable condidtions.\nSince getting out of the service in April I've had a total of 5 jobs. Not from being fired but 1 not paying me, 2 I was going to school and the hours would not work for me. 3 finding a position in my desired field. And 4 I have recently moved states, trying to get a fresh start.\nI move in with my bf(25M) of 2 yrs about a month ago. He has his own issues and sometimes we get on each other's nerves with our separate anxieties but we take care if each other. He makes me wake up with a smile even when everything sucks. He has been the kindest thing for me in these years of torment and change. \nPresent day:\nLast week bf had to take me to th ER for chest pains that lasted for about an hour. They started to feel more and more suffocating. Ik it was a panic attack. Form whatvidk I was literally petting my cats.\nThis new job (job number 5) has not been as ideal as I thought it would be. I have e months experience in my field and moved up fairly quickly compared to others I have alot to learn and this they know and I certainly do know. The first week and a half were hell. I feel as though I was thrown into it and given no direction. This caused me alot of anxiety from which I have made multiple simple mistakes that I know better to make. I'm a month into this job now and I'm not feeling better. I've taken a step back asked a bunch of questions and have followed the other employees around to make myself feel more comfortable and learn more. I've gotten a lot of attitude from one girl who has already been corrected from our supervisor for it( she does it when she's not around, and sup. Isn't around alot) . She walks awaybor ignores me when I try to have a friendly conversation. When I ask how to do something she just says she'll do it, then when I press about it she just ignores me or says she'll do it in a different way. I generally am a smiley person I try to laugh and joke with everyone. Most of the time I am disclcluded form conversations that I try to be apart of ( I listen to everyone talk say something, subject gets changes or ignored). My supervisor has talked to me twice about the anxiety caused mistakes and explained to her I'm taking new anxiety meds to help ( I've been on 3 diff anxiety meds that have either made sick to my stomach or made anxiety worse, now im trying cbd). I've talked with the BF and even my mother who both say do the best I can. Which i am.\n Im just am not comfortable with the environment and people I am with its alot slower than my last job and I clean about 90% of the time to make the day go by faster. I've pretty much made the decision that i dont want to work here anymore, it's literally keeping me up at night thinking about dealing with the next day and I'm just miserable being there. I have not taken anytime down since leaving the military I've literally hoped form job to job and finished school. I just dont want to go on my 6th job within a year. I thought about confronting the girl and the other staff but 3 against 1 would cause issues, and maybe it is just me. I dont know what to do. I know what I want to do.... explain i think i need to take time down with everything going on in my life rn, and say I will not be returning ( I'm on a 90day probationary period so it wouldn't effect me so much ) take a week off then look for a job ( I can find them rather quickly due to military background and because I'm a fucking hard worker no matter what I do).... but would it be the right thing to do. \nI apologize for the long post. I've gone to therapy and no one seems to understand the constant battle I have whether I want to live or die, o dont care. I'm just trying to live my life and not let all the other bs that has happened win. I'm sorry for such a long post. This is the first time I've put all my crap out there. I just dont know what to do. I know I can't keep running away from the shit and that's why I'm on the fence on whether or not to quit this job and take some actual time off. I know I'll be okay financially since I'm good at saving money. I always adapt and over come. I'm just also trying to do the right thing. Again I'm sorry for a long ramblly TMI post. I hope everyone on here finds there happiness and has a good mother fucking day ! Thank you.",

        "query": "I cut down on meds few weeks ago : I have been seeing a psychiatrist for 3 years. My mom and I often take a journey (5 AM in the morning) by train of 3 hours to go to another town where the main hospital is located. The doctor fixes the day for us to visit him. It causes alot of physical and mental harassment since the trains are very crowded in India. Not only that, but we have to wait the entire day in line (in the hospital) just to see the psychiatrist. My mom never lets me stand in queue to get us registered for the appointments. Instead she does it herself. You won't believe but the lines are always long and the amount of patients that the psychiatrist sees in a day is crazy (maybe because it's a famous hospital around here). \nWhen I visited him, the psychiatrist prescribed me a anti-depressant named, BUPOZEN 150mg tablets. I have been eating this tablet religiously day and night like a stupid zombie for 3 years. My parents have always forced me to take it daily thinking there is something wrong with me. They aren't even aware that this tablet is a anti-depressant. The doctor never tells us about it. Just expects us to believe him and take the doses daily. I never skipped a day on the tablets thanks to my overly caring parents. It is very painful to take them though for it feels like I'm some kind of prisoner needing constant reminders from my parents to eat them.\nAll these years, I've doubted if they ever made me feel better but I think I have lost my ability to think after I started taking them. I just couldn't think after taking them. He also had some medication named GPAM that he prescribed me early on when we first visited him in 2017 but later told me to stop taking it  after few months. Since then I have only been adviced to take the BUPOZEN tablets. I googled about this tablet one day to find what they were in 2018 because the psychiatrist never told us what they were and what they did even when I asked him. Later, I discovered they were anti-depressants on the internet. I wonder if I'm so mentally ill that that the doctor thinks I don't have to right to know about my medications (that I'm taking) or does he fear that i will stop taking them after I get to know about them? \nMany times I tried asking him what this tablet was or what it did to me. He always told me that they are meant to increase my concentration in studies. But I never found any increased levels of concentration with it. Instead I have avoided my studies all these years whether I took them or not. I strongly think that he lied.\nI even showed symptoms of schizophrenia and some degree of bipolar according to my psychiatrist.  Once, he was even forcing me to get admitted in the hospital at one of the appointments so he can monitor me closely and check for more mental illnesses. He told me that he would try giving me different medicines and observe my behaviour after I took them to find my illness. I didn't agree to it because mental asylums in India look like a haunted building with crazy people all around. They don't even have proper beds for the patients. The place didn't look so hygienic to me. Moreover, it was mandatory for one of my guardians to stay with me 24/7 while you are admitted there to make sure you  don't harm yourself or the others. They make your parents take responsibility by making them sign some papers before they admit you. All of this scared me and to be honest I saw one of the patient in that particular mental asylum whose body was all shaking like a ghost, like he was possessed by something. He was being interrogated by two doctors while his body was shaking badly. They didn't show any empathy towards him. So, I made some excuses telling the psychiatrist that I have exams to give in college which I did have. He got angry with me but had to accept the excuse.\nNow coming back to 2019. Few weeks ago, I fought with my mom over something and threatened her that I would stop taking the medications. She apologized and requested me to atleast take it once in a day and we agreed on that. I often threaten my parents when things don't go my way because they are over caring and make illogical decisions regarding my life. My life is literally rotting away and a part of me blames them. \nI think my condition has started getting worse after I cut down on the tablet. I only take it once now instead of twice a day. Should I have not cut down on the anti-depressants? \nI'm very sad and have started getting suicidal thoughts back. I cried few nights after I cut down on the meds because I was feeling worthless. I'm getting back suicidal thoughts and all the crazy things that I used to do before I started taking the meds. \nI'm very confused. Did I take the right decision cutting down on the meds without taking the permission of the doctor? What do you guys think I should do?",

Thank you all so much for reading this. I have struggled with extreme mood swings, depression and OCD my entire life. I am just now learning about BPD and think that might be the root cause (of course, I don't know and that would be for a medical professional to diagnose).\nWhen I was little, I would go through manic episodes of thinking I was possessed by demons. My parents put me in therapy and I guess that seemed to help. When I was 13 or so, I developed an eating disorder. I had a horribly abusive childhood and one of my parents took great joy in making me feel like less than a person. This parent, of course, hated themselves so they wanted me to hate myself as much as they hated themselves. They would project so much hatred onto me and make me feel so pathetic and low and even then I knew that that's just how they felt about themselves. It botched my self-esteem beyond all hope (at least that's how I felt). My eating disorder was a way to control my life, that was seemingly out of control.\nWhen I got to college, I began to engage in very risky behavior. I drank to black out and found myself in many situations that could have ended very badly for me. I did all kinds of drugs without thinking anything of it. I would engage in very, very unstable relationships that would often isolate me from any other interactions (other than my romantic partner). I always clung to men who had all the characteristics of my parent who abused me.\nI would distance myself from friendships at random, convinced this person really hated me or was going to leave me at some point. I would go weeks, sometimes months without talking to anyone. I have a very hard time grasping any sort of self-identity' don't even know if I can trust my own perception with myself. I don't feel like any of my perceptions are valid. I will go through days where my energy is off the charts, where I am happy and blissful and then at the drop of a hat I am back to so much depression. Feeling void, sadness. Emptiness.

Today, it's been 2 months since I stop working and in the last year I lost a lot of friends due to my isolation.\n In the past years, I played on console or PC EVERYDAY. If I was not on my PC, I was on my Ipad watching youtube or twitch for hours.I would always structure my life around Gaming and watching watching Youtube. If my friends were asking me if I want to go out with them, I would always think \" Will I have the time to play if I go out?\". You can understand that every estival time of the year was tough for me. Every time that I had those thoughts, I would judge myself, but I kept the same thought process.\nIn mid January, I decide to cut gaming from my life and it's been hard, VERY hard. Since then, there is not one day that I don't think about play again. After I stopped playing video games, I was always on my Ipad watching Twitch and Youtube so I asked my mother to hide it so I can do something other than nothing. Because yes, I was doing nothing, I could not even remember what video I looked 1 hour ago.\nNow that I cut every unhealthy habit from my life, everything should be good and I could begin to live a \"real life\" you would think and so do I.    LOL   I have a phone. Yes the little thing that you always have on you. Yes, that little piece of shit just took the place of my old addiction without me noticing it.\nI started to play mobile games, which I always hated, and been on reddit a lot. When I mean a lot, it's a lot more that you could think of. Yesterday was a pretty sad day and just before trying to go to sleep, I saw the worst nightmare of my life. The REALITY. You have a feature on Iphone that can give you your screen time. Since the beginning of the week, 4 days, I've been on my phone for 44 hours. 44 \\*\\*\\*\\*ing hours, it's more than the half of the time of my week and this screen time doesn't count the time I watch TV.\nI had a panic attack and deleted every game on my phone. So now I'm stuck inside of my house with nothing to do because I'm too anxious to try something new. Welcome in my infinite circle. Just to reassure you guys, I see a therapist at the moment and I hope to get better.\nThank you for reading me and I wish you a beautiful day\nTLDR; I found that for the last years, the only things I did was gaming and watching Youtube/Twitch/Reddit and I didn't have any passion.",

I got prescribed anti-depressants and was on the for a few months. After my prescription ran out I decided not to get it renewed because I didn't like the fact that I needed them to not be depressed. \nFlash forward to last week I went to my doctor for an unrelated reason and she asked me how I was doing, and I told her I was eh. She told me she had noticed that I didn't get my refill after 3 months and if I wanted to go on them again. Using my better judgement I decided to start taking them again and that was that.\nFast forward to about 10 days later and when I went to greet my wife when she got home from work I felt totally different. I asked her if I seemed happier and she told me it was probably the antidepressants. Then it hit me that yeah it does make a huge difference, at least for me.\nAnd I hate it.\nI like not being depressed. I like being able to focus on things I like. I like that I don't need to sit at my desk playing games for extended periods of time. I have an addictive personality so when I get into something I go into it hard and this time it was an MMO. For the past few days I've found myself not playing every chance I got and instead pacing myself until I felt satisfied for the session. I've found more motivation at work and I'm not slogging through the days. I'm not stressing about money, which usually led to me having panic attacks but as I'm writing this it's not even phasing me. Hell, even my libido has been going crazy this past week. Everything feels like it's better than it was 2 weeks ago.\nAnd it's because of this damn pill.\nI'll keep taking it because I know it's for my own good because I've experienced the difference. My doctor doesn't want me on them permanently for now, so I know there's hope I'll be ok in the future. But for now it sucks to know that the only way to fix the way I'm feeling is through medication.",

        "query": "Nothing has ever worked for my depression : I'll try to keep this fairly succinct. I've suffered from major depression for 7.5 years now (am currently 27 male). It came absolutely out of nowhere and I have never been able to figure out what the cause of it is. For all intents and purposes I was having a good life - great social circle, good relationship with family, doing well in school, physically healthy, etc. But for whatever reason one morning I went to class feeling like absolute dogshit. All of the symptoms you can think of, I got - hopelessness, anhedonia, low sex drive, weight fluctuation, suicidal ideation, etc. \nAfter about 2 or 3 months of these feelings persisting with barely any days where I felt happy and normal, I decided to spill the beans and tell family and friends. It went okay, but my mom was initially very skeptical about the whole thing (though she eventually came around) and my best friends were supportive, though many acquaintances stopped talking to me.\nIn December of 2012 I finally decided to seek therapy. It went fairly well, as my therapist was a very kind person, and after about 5 months she finally convinced me to take SSRIs. I was on them for just over a year and they barely made a dent. Felt more emotionless than normal, but it was an improvement. \nI then decided to try a variety of other things as therapy/meds weren't giving me the results that everyone claimed they would deliver. I read a huge 900 page long self help book on CBT. I started doing mindfulness meditation. After grad school I started eating healthier and exercising more. But none of it really did anything long term, just temporary boosts to my overall feeling.\nI got so desperate looking for more solutions that I actually ended up doing magic mushrooms just the other day - it was a mostly extremely pleasant experience but 24 hours later, the dark thoughts about suicide returned, so not even shrooms gave me the magic \"cure\" that helped for so many people.\nThe more I try to alleviate this thing, the more demoralized I become. All these years trying to improve myself and I feel like for every ton of effort I give, I only receive an ounce of results in return. It's getting so exhausting and I simply don't know what to do next. Nothing about the future gives me any hope or anticipation - a new career, a family, a new GF, none of these life goals really make me feel much of anything. All that gives me comfort is sleep, food, music, seeing my brothers every now and then - that's it.\nI don't know how relateable this specific story is. I just needed to vent somewhere using a throwaway account. At this point in another 7.5 years I seriously can't imagine myself making any more progress when it comes to this illness. Every passing year I become more convinced that this condition is unequivocally permanent and untreatable.\nAnyway, thanks for reading. I hope you have a better day than I will.",

I never do go through with it because I'm too anxious it'll be all over the news in my hometown, and because I don't want to be a burden to the one who finds me.\nI'm writing this because it started up again tonight, and I'm sick of not knowing whether I have a serious problem or if it's all just in my head.\nCould this be depression, or am I just overreacting?\nThank you!\n[P.S.: My parents won't allow me to go to a psychologist because it'll ruin our family's reputation, and I don't have money of my own to seek for professional help, so I don't have a way of really knowing. I know this isn't the place to find it, but I just need someone to tell me their opinion on whether or not I could be suffering from depression.]",

It can really help, but in my situation, with my parents I knew it would end this way. I'm still glad that I'm starting therapy so please don't use this post as an excuse to keep your feelings bottled up.\nI'm 17 and I've had depression for at least 7 years now and it's been really serious. I tried to commit suicide mid last year, still feeling just as shitty now as well. Along with my attempt I managed to fail 90% of my classes and year 11 all together. Honestly it's gotten so bad that I can't get myself to do anything at all, I've dropped out of school because I wasn't going there in the first place, and all I do now is stare at walls all day.\nI was never planning on telling my parents. I was thinking of ways I might be able to get a therapist or something without them knowing what I've been through... But as the title suggests, that isn't how it turned out. One day I just got a random boost in confidence that lasted a day and a half, coming down from that made me feel absolutely terrible. One because it reminded me of how terrible I feel 99.9% of the time, and two because during that high I spoke to my mum about this.\nEver since I told my mum I don't feel comfortable around her. I mean I never felt to comfortable around my mum in the first place but it's just gotten worse and worse. The way she talks and acts makes me feel so shitty. And what's even worse is she got me to drop out of school. This pissed of my dad, which then put me in a situation where my mum made me tell my dad, and now I don't feel safe at either house.\nMy mum makes me feel like I'm very useless with her tone being really soft all of a sudden. And my dad constantly has this tone in his voice and the way he acts towards me suggests that I think of myself as some sort of hero or victim in my story and that I need to just grow up and just act like nothings happening. This couldn't be further from the truth because I am 100% aware that despite the fact I can't control it, I am still responsible for anything I do in this state and just because I have serious depression doesn't mean it's not my fault I dropped out of school, and hobbies, or how I ghosted all my friends, I know that I'm still a stubborn piece of sh*t and that despite hating myself more than anything I manage to still have a huge ego. But what I want him to know is that it works the other way around too, just because I'm responsible for these doesn't mean that I'm in control or that I have the physical capability of just changing in the snap of a finger, I want him to know that my 100% isn't the same as his 100% and that he shouldn't expect me to live up to these expectations just because he managed to.",
