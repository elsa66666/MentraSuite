    "query": "Title: Family‐based interventions versus standard care for people with schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPeople with schizophrenia often experience long‐term psychosocial disabilities and frequent relapse. Family plays a key role in caring for ill relatives, which in turn probably contributes to high levels of distress and burdens for the family. Family‐based interventions have been developed and applied to family members and their relatives with schizophrenia to improve their outcomes. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was last updated in 2011, which has been split into this review, one on group‐ versus individual‐based family interventions and one on family‐based cognitive versus behavioural management interventions. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of family‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders and their families compared with standard care. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the following electronic databases from inception until April 2023: CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Clinicaltrials.gov, SinoMed, China Network Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and accessible reviews for additional references. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of family‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders and their families and reported at least one patient’s and one family member’s outcomes. In this update, we only investigated standard care as the comparator. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. The review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for each study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs. We pooled data and estimated effects with the mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We judged the certainty of evidence using GRADEpro GDT. We divided the outcomes into short‐term (≤ 1 month postintervention), medium‐term (> 1 to 6 months postintervention), and long‐term follow‐up (> 6 months postintervention), if available. \nMain results:\nWe identified 26 RCTs in this review, with 1985 people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders, and 2056 family members. Most family‐based interventions were conducted on a weekly or biweekly basis, with duration ranging from five weeks to two years. We had substantial concerns regarding the methodological quality of the included studies given that we judged all studies at high risk of performance bias and several studies at high risk of detection, attrition or reporting bias. Low‐certainty evidence indicated that family‐based interventions may reduce patients' relapse at one month or less postintervention (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.89; 4 RCTs, 229 participants). We downgraded the evidence by two levels due to imprecision (small number of participants) and high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias. Compared to standard care, family‐based interventions probably reduce caregiver burden at one month or less postintervention (MD −5.84, 95% CI −6.77 to −4.92; 8 RCTs, 563 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and may result in more family members shifting from high to low expressed emotion (RR 3.90, 95% CI 1.11 to 13.71; 2 RCTs, 72 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Family interventions may result in little to no difference in patients’ death (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.32; 6 RCTs, 304 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and hospital admission (≤ 1 month postintervention; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.29; 2 RCTs, 153 participants; low‐certainty evidence) in comparison with standard care. Due to the heterogeneous measures and various follow‐up periods, we were unable to provide pooled effect estimates for patients’ compliance with medication and quality of life. We were very uncertain whether family interventions resulted in enhanced compliance with medication and improved quality of life for patients. We downgraded the evidence to very low certainty due to high risk of bias across studies, inconsistency (different directions of effects across studies), and imprecision (small number of participants or CIs of most studies including the possibility of no effect). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review synthesised the latest evidence on family interventions versus standard care for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders and their families. This review suggests that family interventions might improve patients’ outcomes (e.g. relapse) and families’ outcomes (e.g. caregiver burden and expressed emotion), with little to no difference in patients’ hospital admission and adverse effects in terms of death. However, evidence on patients’ compliance with medication and quality of life was very uncertain. Overall, the evidence was of moderate to very low certainty. Future large and well‐designed RCTs are needed to provide more reliable evaluation of effects of family interventions in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like disorders and their families.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Patient Relapse Reduction**: Family-based interventions may reduce patient relapse at one month or less postintervention, supported by low-certainty evidence (RR 0.66).\n\n- **Caregiver Burden**: Family-based interventions probably reduce caregiver burden at one month or less postintervention, as indicated by moderate-certainty evidence (MD −5.84).\n\n- **Expressed Emotion**: These interventions may result in more family members shifting from high to low expressed emotion, according to low-certainty evidence (RR 3.90).\n\n- **Patient Mortality**: There may be little to no effect on patient death when comparing family-based interventions with standard care, supported by low-certainty evidence (RR 0.48).\n\n- **Hospital Admission Rates**: Family-based interventions may result in little to no difference in hospital admission rates within one month postintervention, based on low-certainty evidence (RR 0.81).\n\n- **Medication Compliance**: There is very low-certainty evidence, and therefore high uncertainty, regarding the effect of family interventions on patient compliance with medication.\n\n- **Quality of Life**: The impact of family interventions on patients' quality of life is also highly uncertain due to very low-certainty evidence.\n\nEach of these points reflects a scoring reference based on the evidence certainty and observed effects of family-based interventions in comparison to standard care for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders and their families."

    "query": "Title: Transitional discharge interventions for people with schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSchizophrenia is a chronic mental illness characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and important functional and social disability. Interventions labeled as 'transitional' add to care plans made during the hospital stay in preparation for discharge. They also include interventions developed after discharge to support people with serious mental illness as they make the transition from the hospital to the community. Transitional discharge interventions may anticipate the future needs of the patient after discharge by co‐ordinating the different levels of the health system that can effectively guarantee continuity of care in the community. This occurs through the provision of therapeutic relationships which give a safety net throughout the discharge and community reintegration processes to improve the general condition of users, level of functioning, use of health resources, and satisfaction with care. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of transitional discharge interventions for people with schizophrenia. \nSearch methods:\nOn 7 December 2022, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, PsycINFO, and WHO ICTRP. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of transitional discharge interventions in people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐related disorders. Eligible interventions included three key elements: predischarge planning, co‐ordination of care and follow‐up, and postdischarge support. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. Outcomes of this review included global state (relapse), service use (hospitalization), general functioning, satisfaction with care, adverse effects/events, quality of life, and direct costs. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) and their 95% CIs. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. \nMain results:\nWe found 12 studies with 1748 participants comparing transitional discharge interventions to usual care. All were parallel‐group RCTs. No studies assessed global state (relapse) or reported data about adverse events/effects. All studies had a high risk of bias, mainly due to serious concerns about allocation concealment, deviations from intended interventions, measurement of the outcomes, and missing outcome data. Transitional discharge interventions may make little to no difference in service use (hospitalization) at short‐ and long‐term follow‐ups, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.50; I 2  = 54%; 4 studies, 462 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Transitional discharge intervention may increase the levels of functioning after discharge (clinically important change in general functioning) (SMD 0.95, 95% CI −0.06 to 1.97; I² = 95%; 4 studies, 437 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and may increase the proportion of participants who are satisfied with the intervention (clinically important change in satisfaction) (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.80; 1 study, 76 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but for both outcomes the evidence is very uncertain. Transitional discharge intervention may make little to no difference in quality of life compared to treatment as usual (SMD 0.24, 95% CI −0.30 to 0.78; I² = 90%; 4 studies, 748 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but we are very uncertain. For direct costs, one study with 124 participants did not report full details and thus the results were inconclusive. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is currently no clear evidence for or against implementing transitional discharge interventions for people with schizophrenia. Transitional discharge interventions may improve patient satisfaction and functionality, but this evidence is also very uncertain. For future research, it is important to improve the quality of the conduct and reporting of these trials, including using validated tools for measuring their outcomes.",
    "reference_answer": "The full score answers related to the findings of the study on transitional discharge interventions for people with schizophrenia should be based on evaluating how well these interventions meet specific criteria outlined in the research. Here is a structured set of scoring reference points:\n\n- **Global State (Relapse):**\n  - Inclusion of relapse data in the study with clear reporting methods.\n  - Robust assessment and clear presentation of results.\n  - Sensitivity in measuring changes in relapse rates before and after intervention.\n\n- **Service Use (Hospitalization):**\n  - Transparent reporting on hospitalization rates pre and post-intervention.\n  - Comprehensive analysis of short-term versus long-term service use impacts.\n  - Evaluation of the intervention's influence on hospitalization frequency.\n\n- **General Functioning:**\n  - Detailed evaluation of changes in functioning levels with quantifiable metrics.\n  - Clear differentiation between clinically important changes and statistical variations.\n  - Assessment of diverse aspects of functioning not limited to just social or occupational.\n\n- **Satisfaction with Care:**\n  - Comprehensive survey of participant satisfaction with a clear scoring system.\n  - Assessment of individual versus group satisfaction trends.\n  - Consideration of subjective versus objective satisfaction indices.\n\n- **Adverse Effects/Events:**\n  - Inclusion of adverse effects/event monitoring and explicit documentation.\n  - Comparison with control groups or usual care benchmarks.\n  - Protocol for recording and analysis of adverse events linked to interventions.\n\n- **Quality of Life:**\n  - Use of validated quality of life scales with predefined metrics for scoring.\n  - Analysis of quality of life improvements with respect to standard care.\n  - Longitudinal studies evaluating the impact on life quality over time.\n\n- **Direct Costs:**\n  - Inclusion of complete financial analysis with itemized direct cost breakdown.\n  - Assessment of intervention-related costs versus financial benefits.\n  - Evaluation of cost-effectiveness and sustainability perspective.\n\nEach criterion should assess both clinical and methodological aspects, considering both the transparency in reporting and the validity of measures used.

    "query": "Title: Cognitive behavioural therapy and third‐wave approaches for anxiety and related disorders in older people\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most researched psychological therapy for anxiety disorders in adults, and known to be effective in this population. However, it remains unclear whether these results apply to older adults, as most studies include participants between 18 and 55 years of age. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and up‐to‐date synthesis of the available evidence on CBT and third wave approaches for older adults with anxiety and related disorders. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CT, BT, CBT and third‐wave CBT interventions) on severity of anxiety symptoms compared with minimal management (not providing therapy) for anxiety and related disorders in older adults, aged 55 years or over. To assess the effects of CBT and related therapies on severity of anxiety symptoms compared with other psychological therapies for anxiety and related disorders in older adults, aged 55 years or over. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled studies Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and Ovid PsycINFO to 21 July 2022. These searches were updated on 2 February 2024. We also searched the international studies registries, including Clinicalstudies.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), to identify additional ongoing and unpublished studies. These sources were manually searched for studies up to 12 February 2024. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in older adults (≥ 55 years) with an anxiety disorder, or a related disorder, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), acute stress disorder and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), that compared CBT to either minimal management or an active (non‐CBT) psychological therapy. Eligible studies had to have an anxiety‐related outcome. \nData collection and analysis:\nSeveral authors independently screened all titles identified by the searches. All full texts were screened for eligibility according to our prespecified selection criteria. Data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for RCTs. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. Meta‐analyses were performed for outcomes with quantitative data from more than one study. \nMain results:\nWe included 21 RCTs on 1234 older people allocated to either CBT or control conditions. Ten studies focused on generalised anxiety disorder; others mostly included a mix of clinical diagnoses. Nineteen studies focused on the comparison between CBT and minimal management. Key issues relating to risk of bias were lack of blinding of participants and personnel, and participants dropping out of studies, potentially due to treatment preference and allocation. CBT may result in a small‐to‐moderate reduction of anxiety post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.36, low‐certainty evidence). However, compared to this benefit with CBT immediately after treatment, at three to six months post‐treatment, there was little to no difference between CBT and minimal management (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.01, low‐certainty evidence). CBT may have little or no effect on clinical recovery/ improvement post‐treatment compared to minimal management, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.03, very low‐certainty evidence). Results indicate that five people would need to receive treatment for one additional person to benefit (NNTB = 5). Compared to minimal management, CBT may result in a reduction of comorbid depression symptoms post‐treatment (SMD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐0.74 to ‐0.40, low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference in dropout rates post‐treatment, although the certainty of the evidence was low (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.78). Two studies reported adverse events, both of which related to medication in the control groups (very low‐certainty evidence, no quantitative estimate). Only two studies compared CBT to other psychological therapies, both of which only included participants with post‐traumatic stress disorder. Low‐certainty evidence showed no difference in anxiety severity post‐treatment and at four to six months post‐treatment, symptoms of depression post‐treatment, and dropout rates post‐treatment. Other outcomes and time points are reported in the results section of the manuscript. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nCBT may be more effective than minimal management in reducing anxiety and symptoms of worry and depression post‐treatment in older adults with anxiety disorders. The evidence is less certain longer‐term and for other outcomes including clinical recovery/improvement. There is not enough evidence to determine whether CBT is more effective than alternative psychological therapies for anxiety in older adults.",

    "query": "Title: Haloperidol (oral) versus olanzapine (oral) for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSchizophrenia is often a severe and disabling psychiatric disorder. Antipsychotics remain the mainstay of psychotropic treatment for people with psychosis. In limited resource and humanitarian contexts, it is key to have several options for beneficial, low‐cost antipsychotics, which require minimal monitoring. We wanted to compare oral haloperidol, as one of the most available antipsychotics in these settings, with a second‐generation antipsychotic, olanzapine. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the clinical benefits and harms of haloperidol compared to olanzapine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia study‐based register of trials, which is based on monthly searches of CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed and WHO ICTRP. We screened the references of all included studies. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information where clarification was required or where data were incomplete. The register was last searched on 14 January 2023. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomised clinical trials comparing haloperidol with olanzapine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in global state, relapse, clinically important change in mental state, extrapyramidal side effects, weight increase, clinically important change in quality of life and leaving the study early due to adverse effects. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently evaluated and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial or harmful outcome (NNTB or NNTH) with 95% CI. For continuous data, we estimated mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. For all included studies, we assessed risk of bias (RoB 1) and we used the GRADE approach to create a summary of findings table. \nMain results:\nWe included 68 studies randomising 9132 participants. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference between haloperidol and olanzapine in clinically important change in global state (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 6 studies, 3078 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether there is a difference between haloperidol and olanzapine in relapse (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.02; 7 studies, 1499 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Haloperidol may reduce the incidence of clinically important change in overall mental state compared to olanzapine (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.81; 13 studies, 1210 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For every eight people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one fewer person would experience this improvement. The evidence suggests that haloperidol may result in a large increase in extrapyramidal side effects compared to olanzapine (RR 3.38, 95% CI 2.28 to 5.02; 14 studies, 3290 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For every three people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one additional person would experience extrapyramidal side effects. For weight gain, the evidence suggests that there may be a large reduction in the risk with haloperidol compared to olanzapine (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; 18 studies, 4302 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For every 10 people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one fewer person would experience weight increase. A single study suggests that haloperidol may reduce the incidence of clinically important change in quality of life compared to olanzapine (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 828 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For every nine people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one fewer person would experience clinically important improvement in quality of life. Haloperidol may result in an increase in the incidence of leaving the study early due to adverse effects compared to olanzapine (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.47; 21 studies, 5047 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For every 22 people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one fewer person would experience this outcome. Thirty otherwise relevant studies and several endpoints from 14 included studies could not be evaluated due to inconsistencies and poor transparency of several parameters. Furthermore, even within studies that were included, it was often not possible to use data for the same reasons. Risk of bias differed substantially for different outcomes and the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low. The most common risks of bias leading to downgrading of the evidence were blinding (performance bias) and selective reporting (reporting bias). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOverall, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low for the main outcomes in this review, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference between haloperidol and olanzapine in terms of clinically important global state and relapse. Olanzapine may result in a slightly greater overall clinically important change in mental state and in a clinically important change in quality of life. Different side effect profiles were noted: haloperidol may result in a large increase in extrapyramidal side effects and olanzapine in a large increase in weight gain. The drug of choice needs to take into account side effect profiles and the preferences of the individual. These findings and the recent inclusion of olanzapine alongside haloperidol in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines should increase the likelihood of it becoming more easily available in low‐ and middle‐ income countries, thereby improving choice and providing a greater ability to respond to side effects for people with lived experience of schizophrenia. There is a need for additional research using appropriate and equivalent dosages of these drugs. Some of this research needs to be done in low‐ and middle‐income settings and should actively seek to account for factors relevant to these. Research on antipsychotics needs to be person‐centred and prioritise factors that are of interest to people with lived experience of schizophrenia.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the given abstract and full-score answers, here are the scoring reference points for evaluating the main findings:\n\n- **Global State and Relapse:**\n  - There is very low-certainty evidence regarding the differences in the global state changes between haloperidol and olanzapine.\n  - There is very low-certainty evidence regarding differences in relapse rates between haloperidol and olanzapine.\n\n- **Mental State:**\n  - Haloperidol may reduce the incidence of clinically important changes in the mental state compared to olanzapine (low-certainty evidence).\n\n- **Extrapyramidal Side Effects:**\n  - Haloperidol is associated with a significant increase in extrapyramidal side effects compared to olanzapine (low-certainty evidence).\n\n- **Weight Gain:**\n  - A reduction in weight gain is observed with haloperidol compared to olanzapine (low-certainty evidence).\n\n- **Quality of Life:**\n  - Haloperidol may reduce the quality of life compared to olanzapine (low-certainty evidence).\n\n- **Study Dropouts Due to Adverse Effects:**\n  - There is an increase in participants leaving the study early due to adverse effects with haloperidol use compared to olanzapine (low-certainty evidence).\n\nEach of these points represents an essential criterion for scoring the main findings and should be considered when evaluating similar studies."

    "query": "Title: Collaborative care approaches for people with severe mental illness\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nCollaborative care for severe mental illness (SMI) is a community‐based intervention that promotes interdisciplinary working across primary and secondary care. Collaborative care interventions aim to improve the physical and/or mental health care of individuals with SMI. This is an update of a 2013 Cochrane review, based on new searches of the literature, which includes an additional seven studies. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness of collaborative care approaches in comparison with standard care (or other non‐collaborative care interventions) for people with diagnoses of SMI who are living in the community. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Study‐Based Register of Trials (10 February 2021). We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders (CCMD) controlled trials register (all available years to 6 June 2016). Subsequent searches on Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO together with the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (with an overlap) were run on 17 December 2021. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) where interventions described as 'collaborative care' were compared with 'standard care' for adults (18+ years) living in the community with a diagnosis of SMI. SMI was defined as schizophrenia, other types of schizophrenia‐like psychosis or bipolar affective disorder. The primary outcomes of interest were: quality of life, mental state and psychiatric admissions at 12 months follow‐up. \nData collection and analysis:\nPairs of authors independently extracted data. We assessed the quality and certainty of the evidence using RoB 2 (for the primary outcomes) and GRADE. We compared treatment effects between collaborative care and standard care. We divided outcomes into short‐term (up to six months), medium‐term (seven to 12 months) and long‐term (over 12 months). For dichotomous data we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and for continuous data we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used random‐effects meta‐analyses due to substantial levels of heterogeneity across trials. We created a summary of findings table using GRADEpro. \nMain results:\nEight RCTs (1165 participants) are included in this review. Two met the criteria for type A collaborative care (intervention comprised of the four core components). The remaining six met the criteria for type B (described as collaborative care by the trialists, but not comprised of the four core components). The composition and purpose of the interventions varied across studies. For most outcomes there was low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence . We found three studies that assessed the quality of life of participants at 12 months. Quality of life was measured using the SF‐12 and the WHOQOL‐BREF and the mean endpoint mental health component scores were reported at 12 months. Very low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in quality of life (mental health domain) between collaborative care and standard care in the medium term (at 12 months) (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.26 to 0.32; 3 RCTs, 227 participants). Very low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in quality of life (physical health domain) between collaborative care and standard care in the medium term (at 12 months) (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.33; 3 RCTs, 237 participants). Furthermore, in the medium term (at 12 months) low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference between collaborative care and standard care in mental state (binary) (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.28; 1 RCT, 253 participants) or in the risk of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital at 12 months (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 39.57; 1 RCT, 253 participants). One study indicated an improvement in disability (proxy for social functioning) at 12 months in the collaborative care arm compared to usual care (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.95; 1 RCT, 253 participants); we deemed this low‐certainty evidence. Personal recovery and satisfaction/experience of care outcomes were not reported in any of the included studies. The data from one study indicated that the collaborative care treatment was more expensive than standard care (mean difference (MD) international dollars (Int$) 493.00, 95% CI 345.41 to 640.59) in the short term. Another study found the collaborative care intervention to be slightly less expensive at three years. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review does not provide evidence to indicate that collaborative care is more effective than standard care in the medium term (at 12 months) in relation to our primary outcomes (quality of life, mental state and psychiatric admissions).

    "query": "Title: Risk assessment for aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAggressive or violent behaviour is often associated with people with schizophrenia in common perceptions of the disease. Risk assessment methods have been used to identify and evaluate the behaviour of those individuals who are at the greatest risk of perpetrating aggression or violence or characterise the likelihood to commit acts. Although many different interventions have been developed to decrease aggressive or violent incidences in inpatient care, staff working in inpatient settings seek easy‐to‐use methods to decrease patient aggressive events. However, many of these are time‐consuming, and they require intensive training for staff and patient monitoring. It has also been recognised in clinical practice that if staff monitor patients' behaviour in a structured manner, the monitoring itself may result in a reduction of aggressive/violent behaviour and incidents in psychiatric settings. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of structured aggression or violence risk assessment methods for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP, on 10 February 2021. We also inspected references of all identified studies. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing structured risk assessment methods added to standard professional care with standard professional care for the evaluation of aggressive or violent behaviour among people with schizophrenia. \nData collection and analysis:\nAt least two review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and its 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies and created a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included four studies in the review. The total number of participants was not identifiable, as some studies provided number of participants included, and some only patient days. The studies compared a package of structured assessment methods with a control group that included routine nursing care and drug therapy or unstructured psychiatric observations/treatment based on clinical judgement. In two studies, information about treatment in control care was not available. One study reported results for our primary outcome, clinically important change in aggressive/violent behaviour, measured by the rate of severe aggression events. There was likely a positive effect favouring structured risk assessment over standard professional care (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85; 1 RCT; 1852 participants; corrected for cluster design: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93; moderate‐certainty evidence). One trial reported data for the use of coercive measures (seclusion room). Compared to standard professional care, structured risk assessment may have little or no effect on use of seclusion room as days (corrected for cluster design: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.07; N = 20; low‐certainty evidence) or use of seclusion room as secluded participants (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.39 to 8.7; 1 RCT; N = 20; low‐certainty evidence). However, seclusion room may be used less frequently in the standard professional care group compared to the structured risk assessment group (incidence) (corrected for cluster design: RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.47; 1 RCT; N = 20; substantial heterogeneity, Chi 2  = 0.0; df = 0.0; P = 0.0; I 2  = 100%; low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a clear effect on adverse events of escape (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.11; 1 RCT; n = 200; very low‐certainty evidence); fall down (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.15; 1 RCT; n = 200; very low‐certainty evidence); or choking (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.11; 1 RCT; n = 200; very low‐certainty evidence) when comparing structured risk assessment to standard professional care. There were no useable data for patient‐related outcomes such as global state, acceptance of treatment, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life, service use, or costs. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nBased on the available evidence, it is not possible to conclude that structured aggression or violence risk assessment methods are effective for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. Future work should combine the use of interventions and structured risk assessment methods to prevent aggressive incidents in psychiatric inpatient settings.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the findings presented, here is a complete set of scoring reference points for evaluating the effectiveness of structured risk assessment methods in managing aggressive behavior in schizophrenia:\n\n- **Severe Aggression Events Reduction:**\n  - Criterion: Evidence of reduction in the occurrence of severe aggression events when using structured risk assessments.\n  - Reference Data: RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.85), moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Coercive Measures (Seclusion Room) Usage:**\n  - Criterion: Little to no clear effect observed on the frequency of seclusion room usage.\n  - Reference Data: Corrected RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.27 to 3.07) for days; RR 1.83 (95% CI 0.39 to 8.7) for secluded participants; low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Adverse Events (Escape, Fall, Choking):**\n  - Criterion: Minimal effect observed on adverse events such as escape, falls, and choking.\n  - Reference Data: Escape RR 0.2 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.11); Fall down RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.04 to 3.15); Choking RR 0.2 (95% CI 0.01 to 4.11); very low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Broader Patient-Related Outcomes:**\n  - Criterion: Absence of useable data on outcomes including patient global state, acceptance of treatment, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life, service use, and costs.\n\n- **Structured vs. Standard Professional Care:**\n  - Criterion: General comparison showing potential benefits in aggression reduction but no definitive efficacy in reducing coercive measures or improving broader patient outcomes.\n\nThese criteria provide a systematic evaluation of the main outcomes from the study, encapsulating both the beneficial aspects and limitations of structured risk assessments in aggressive behavior management within schizophrenia care."

    "query": "Title: Psychological interventions for depression and anxiety in patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure or atrial fibrillation\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDepression and anxiety occur frequently (with reported prevalence rates of around 40%) in individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF) or atrial fibrillation (AF) and are associated with a poor prognosis, such as decreased health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), and increased morbidity and mortality. Psychological interventions are developed and delivered by psychologists or specifically trained healthcare workers and commonly include cognitive behavioural therapies and mindfulness‐based stress reduction. They have been shown to reduce depression and anxiety in the general population, though the exact mechanism of action is not well understood. Further, their effects on psychological and clinical outcomes in patients with CHD, HF or AF are unclear. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of psychological interventions (alone, or with cardiac rehabilitation or pharmacotherapy, or both) in adults who have a diagnosis of CHD, HF or AF, compared to no psychological intervention, on psychological and clinical outcomes. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases from 2009 to July 2022. We also searched three clinical trials registers in September 2020, and checked the reference lists of included studies. No language restrictions were applied. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological interventions with no psychological intervention for a minimum of six months follow‐up in adults aged over 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of CHD, HF or AF, with or without depression or anxiety. Studies had to report on either depression or anxiety or both. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were depression and anxiety, and our secondary outcomes of interest were HRQoL mental and physical components, all‐cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. \nMain results:\nTwenty‐one studies (2591 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies included people with CHD, five with HF and none with AF. Study sample sizes ranged from 29 to 430. Twenty and 17 studies reported the primary outcomes of depression and anxiety, respectively. Despite the high heterogeneity and variation, we decided to pool the studies using a random‐effects model, recognising that the model does not eliminate heterogeneity and findings should be interpreted cautiously. We found that psychological interventions probably have a moderate effect on reducing depression (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.65 to ‐0.06; 20 studies, 2531 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and anxiety (SMD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐0.96 to ‐0.18; 17 studies, 2235 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), compared to no psychological intervention. Psychological interventions may have little to no effect on HRQoL physical component summary scores (PCS) (SMD 0.48, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.98; 12 studies, 1454 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but may have a moderate effect on improving HRQoL mental component summary scores (MCS) (SMD 0.63, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.26; 12 studies, 1454 participants; low‐certainty evidence), compared to no psychological intervention. Psychological interventions probably have little to no effect on all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.69; 3 studies, 615 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and may have little to no effect on MACE (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.92; 4 studies, 450 participants; low‐certainty evidence), compared to no psychological intervention. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nCurrent evidence suggests that psychological interventions for depression and anxiety probably result in a moderate reduction in depression and anxiety and may result in a moderate improvement in HRQoL MCS, compared to no intervention. However, they may have little to no effect on HRQoL PCS and MACE, and probably do not reduce mortality (all‐cause) in adults who have a diagnosis of CHD or HF, compared with no psychological intervention. There was moderate to substantial heterogeneity identified across studies. Thus, evidence of treatment effects on these outcomes warrants careful interpretation. As there were no studies of psychological interventions for patients with AF included in our review, this is a gap that needs to be addressed in future studies, particularly in view of the rapid growth of research on management of AF. Studies investigating cost‐effectiveness, return to work and cardiovascular morbidity (revascularisation) are also needed to better understand the benefits of psychological interventions in populations with heart disease.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the abstract and full-score findings, the scoring reference points can be structured as follows:\n\n- **Effect on Depression:**\n  - Moderate reduction in depression as indicated by psychological interventions (SMD ‐0.36, 95% CI ‐0.65 to ‐0.06).\n  - Moderate-certainty evidence supports this finding.\n\n- **Effect on Anxiety:**\n  - Moderate reduction in anxiety through psychological interventions (SMD ‐0.57, 95% CI ‐0.96 to ‐0.18).\n  - Supported by moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Effect on HRQoL Mental Component Summary (MCS) Scores:**\n  - Possible moderate improvement in MCS with psychological interventions (SMD 0.63, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.26).\n  - This finding has low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Effect on HRQoL Physical Component Summary (PCS) Scores:**\n  - Psychological interventions may have little to no effect on PCS (SMD 0.48, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.98).\n  - Low-certainty evidence supports this conclusion.\n\n- **Impact on All-Cause Mortality:**\n  - Psychological interventions likely have little to no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.69).\n  - Supported by moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Impact on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE):**\n  - These interventions may have little to no effect on MACE (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.92).\n  - Low-certainty evidence backs this finding.\n\nThese reference points should guide the interpretation of the study findings regarding the effectiveness of psychological interventions in patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation, as summarized in the abstract and main findings."

    "query": "Title: Psychological therapies for depression in older adults residing in long‐term care settings\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDepression is common amongst older people residing in long‐term care (LTC) facilities. Currently, most residents treated for depression are prescribed antidepressant medications, despite the potential availability of psychological therapies that are suitable for older people and a preference amongst many older people for non‐pharmacological treatment approaches. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effect of psychological therapies for depression in older people living in LTC settings, in comparison with treatment as usual, waiting list control, and non‐specific attentional control; and to compare the effectiveness of different types of psychological therapies in this setting. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, five grey literature sources, and two trial registers. We performed reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. The latest search was 31 October 2021. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of any type of psychological therapy for the treatment of depression in adults aged 65 years and over residing in a LTC facility. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts for inclusion. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We contacted study authors for additional information where required. Primary outcomes were level of depressive symptomatology and treatment non‐acceptability; secondary outcomes included depression remission, quality of life or psychological well‐being, and level of anxious symptomatology. We used Review Manager 5 to conduct meta‐analyses, using pairwise random‐effects models. For continuous data, we calculated standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using endpoint data, and for dichotomous data, we used odds ratios and 95% CIs. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. \nMain results:\nWe included 19 RCTs with 873 participants; 16 parallel group RCTs and three cluster‐RCTs. Most studies compared psychological therapy (typically including elements of cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural therapy, reminiscence therapy, or a combination of these) to treatment as usual or to a condition controlling for the effects of attention. We found very low‐certainty evidence that psychological therapies were more effective than non‐therapy control conditions in reducing symptoms of depression, with a large effect size at end‐of‐intervention (SMD −1.04, 95% CI −1.49 to −0.58; 18 RCTs, 644 participants) and at short‐term (up to three months) follow‐up (SMD −1.03, 95% CI −1.49 to −0.56; 16 RCTs, 512 participants). In addition, very low‐certainty evidence from a single study with 82 participants indicated that psychological therapy was associated with a greater reduction in the number of participants presenting with major depressive disorder compared to treatment as usual control, at end‐of‐intervention and short‐term follow‐up. However, given the limited data on the effect of psychological therapies on remission of major depressive disorder, caution is advised in interpreting this result. Participants receiving psychological therapy were more likely to drop out of the trial than participants receiving a non‐therapy control (odds ratio 3.44, 95% CI 1.19 to 9.93), which may indicate higher treatment non‐acceptability. However, analyses were restricted due to limited dropout case data and imprecise reporting, and the finding should be interpreted with caution. There was very low‐certainty evidence that psychological therapy was more effective than non‐therapy control conditions in improving quality of life and psychological well‐being at short‐term follow‐up, with a medium effect size (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; 5 RCTs, 170 participants), but the effect size was small at postintervention (SMD 0.40, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.82; 6 RCTs, 195 participants). There was very low‐certainty evidence of no effect of psychological therapy on anxiety symptoms postintervention (SMD −0.68, 95% CI −2.50 to 1.14; 2 RCTs, 115 participants), although results lacked precision, and there was insufficient data to determine short‐term outcomes. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis systematic review suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural therapy, and reminiscence therapy may reduce depressive symptoms compared with usual care for LTC residents, but the evidence is very uncertain. Psychological therapies may also improve quality of life and psychological well‐being amongst depressed LTC residents in the short term, but may have no effect on symptoms of anxiety in depressed LTC residents, compared to control conditions. However, the evidence for these effects is very uncertain, limiting our confidence in the findings. The evidence could be strengthened by better reporting and higher‐quality RCTs of psychological therapies in LTC, including trials with larger samples, reporting results separately for those with and without cognitive impairment and dementia, and longer‐term outcomes to determine when effects wane.",

    "query": "Title: Pharmacological treatments in panic disorder in adults: a network meta‐analysis\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nA panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes. The main symptoms involve bodily systems, such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, churning stomach, faintness and breathlessness. Other recognised panic attack symptoms involve fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad or dying, and derealisation (the sensation that the world is unreal). Panic disorder is common in the general population with a prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions, including antidepressants and benzodiazepines. \nObjectives:\nTo compare, via network meta‐analysis, individual drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) or placebo in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. To rank individual active drugs for panic disorder (antidepressants, benzodiazepines and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To rank drug classes for panic disorder (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono‐amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and benzodiazepines (BDZs) and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To explore heterogeneity and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in a network meta‐analysis. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, CENTRAL, CDSR, MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and PsycINFO to 26 May 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people aged 18 years or older of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. We included trials that compared the effectiveness of antidepressants and benzodiazepines with each other or with a placebo. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data and continuous data as risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD): response to treatment (i.e. substantial improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), total number of dropouts due to any reason (as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability: dichotomous outcome), remission (i.e. satisfactory end state as defined by global judgement of the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), panic symptom scales and global judgement (continuous outcome), frequency of panic attacks (as recorded, for example, by a panic diary; continuous outcome), agoraphobia (dichotomous outcome). We assessed the certainty of evidence using threshold analyses. \nMain results:\nOverall, we included 70 trials in this review. Sample sizes ranged between 5 and 445 participants in each arm, and the total sample size per study ranged from 10 to 1168. Thirty‐five studies included sample sizes of over 100 participants. There is evidence from 48 RCTs (N = 10,118) that most medications are more effective in the response outcome than placebo. In particular, diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine and adinazolam showed the strongest effect, with diazepam, alprazolam and clonazepam ranking as the most effective. We found heterogeneity in most of the comparisons, but our threshold analyses suggest that this is unlikely to impact the findings of the network meta‐analysis. Results from 64 RCTs (N = 12,310) suggest that most medications are associated with either a reduced or similar risk of dropouts to placebo. Alprazolam and diazepam were associated with a lower dropout rate compared to placebo and were ranked as the most tolerated of all the medications examined. Thirty‐two RCTs (N = 8569) were included in the remission outcome. Most medications were more effective than placebo, namely desipramine, fluoxetine, clonazepam, diazepam, fluvoxamine, imipramine, venlafaxine and paroxetine, and their effects were clinically meaningful. Amongst these medications, desipramine and alprazolam were ranked highest. Thirty‐five RCTs (N = 8826) are included in the continuous outcome reduction in panic scale scores. Brofaromine, clonazepam and reboxetine had the strongest reductions in panic symptoms compared to placebo, but results were based on either one trial or very small trials. Forty‐one RCTs (N = 7853) are included in the frequency of panic attack outcome. Only clonazepam and alprazolam showed a strong reduction in the frequency of panic attacks compared to placebo, and were ranked highest. Twenty‐six RCTs (N = 7044) provided data for agoraphobia. The strongest reductions in agoraphobia symptoms were found for citalopram, reboxetine, escitalopram, clomipramine and diazepam, compared to placebo. For the pooled intervention classes, we examined the two primary outcomes (response and dropout). The classes of medication were: SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs. For the response outcome, all classes of medications examined were more effective than placebo. TCAs as a class ranked as the most effective, followed by BDZs and MAOIs. SSRIs as a class ranked fifth on average, while SNRIs were ranked lowest. When we compared classes of medication with each other for the response outcome, we found no difference between classes. Comparisons between MAOIs and TCAs and between BDZs and TCAs also suggested no differences between these medications, but the results were imprecise. For the dropout outcome, BDZs were the only class associated with a lower dropout compared to placebo and were ranked first in terms of tolerability. The other classes did not show any difference in dropouts compared to placebo. In terms of ranking, TCAs are on average second to BDZs, followed by SNRIs, then by SSRIs and lastly by MAOIs. BDZs were associated with lower dropout rates compared to SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs. The quality of the studies comparing antidepressants with placebo was moderate, while the quality of the studies comparing BDZs with placebo and antidepressants was low. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nIn terms of efficacy, SSRIs, SNRIs (venlafaxine), TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs may be effective, with little difference between classes. However, it is important to note that the reliability of these findings may be limited due to the overall low quality of the studies, with all having unclear or high risk of bias across multiple domains. Within classes, some differences emerged. For example, amongst the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine seem to have stronger evidence of efficacy than sertraline. Benzodiazepines appear to have a small but significant advantage in terms of tolerability (incidence of dropouts) over other classes.",
    "reference_answer": "To create a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings, the essential scoring criteria are structured as follows:\n\n- **Efficacy Criteria:**\n  - The medications diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine, and adinazolam must demonstrate higher efficacy than placebo in the treatment of panic disorder.\n  - Among SSRIs, paroxetine and fluoxetine should show stronger evidence of efficacy compared to sertraline.\n  - Desipramine and alprazolam should rank highest in remission outcomes, significantly surpassing placebo.\n\n- **Tolerability Criteria:**\n  - Benzodiazepines, particularly diazepam and alprazolam, must demonstrate lower dropout rates compared to placebo and other medication classes, reflecting superior tolerability.\n  - The BDZs class should consistently rank first in terms of tolerability compared to SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs.\n\n- **Symptom Reduction Criteria:**\n  - Clonazepam and alprazolam should show notable efficacy in reducing the frequency of panic attacks more significantly than placebo.\n  - In the context of agoraphobia, citalopram, reboxetine, escitalopram, clomipramine, and diazepam need to be particularly effective compared to placebo.\n\n- **Class Ranking Criteria:**\n  - TCAs must rank as the most effective class for response outcomes.\n  - BDZs should be the most favorable class in terms of tolerability, showcasing lower dropouts.\n  - Among medication classes, there should be little difference observed, but TCAs rank first for efficacy, followed by BDZs and MAOIs.\n  - SNRIs should rank lowest in terms of efficacy, while BDZs should consistently exhibit lower dropout rates compared to SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence Criteria:**\n  - The findings must reflect the moderate quality of studies comparing antidepressants with placebo.\n  - Findings comparing BDZs with placebo and antidepressants are based on low-quality studies and should be interpreted with caution due to an unclear or high risk of bias.\n\nThese scoring criteria provide a detailed framework to evaluate and interpret the effectiveness, tolerability, and general outcomes of pharmacological treatments in panic disorder."

    "query": "Title: Psychosocial interventions for survivors of rape and sexual assault experienced during adulthood\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nExposure to rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse has lifelong impacts for mental health and well‐being. Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) are among the most common interventions offered to survivors to alleviate post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological impacts. Beyond such trauma‐focused cognitive and behavioural approaches, there is a range of low‐intensity interventions along with new and emerging non‐exposure based approaches (trauma‐sensitive yoga, Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories and Lifespan Integration). This review presents a timely assessment of international evidence on any type of psychosocial intervention offered to individuals who experienced rape, sexual assault or sexual abuse as adults. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of psychosocial interventions on mental health and well‐being for survivors of rape, sexual assault or sexual abuse experienced during adulthood. \nSearch methods:\nIn January 2022, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 12 other databases and three trials registers. We also checked reference lists of included studies, contacted authors and experts, and ran forward citation searches. \nSelection criteria:\nAny study that allocated individuals or clusters of individuals by a random or quasi‐random method to a psychosocial intervention that promoted recovery and healing following exposure to rape, sexual assault or sexual abuse in those aged 18 years and above compared with no or minimal intervention, usual care, wait‐list, pharmacological only or active comparison(s). We classified psychosocial interventions according to Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group’s psychological therapies list. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. \nMain results:\nWe included 36 studies (1991 to 2021) with 3992 participants randomly assigned to 60 experimental groups (3014; 76%) and 23 inactive comparator conditions (978, 24%). The experimental groups consisted of: 32 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT); 10 behavioural interventions; three integrative therapies; three humanist; five other psychologically oriented interventions; and seven other psychosocial interventions. Delivery involved 1 to 20 (median 11) sessions of traditional face‐to‐face (41) or other individual formats (four); groups (nine); or involved computer‐only interaction (six). Most studies were conducted in the USA (n = 26); two were from South Africa; two from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; with single studies from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Five studies did not disclose a funding source, and all disclosed sources were public funding. Participants were invited from a range of settings: from the community, through the media, from universities and in places where people might seek help for their mental health (e.g. war veterans), in the aftermath of sexual trauma (sexual assault centres and emergency departments) or for problems that accompany the experience of sexual violence (e.g. sexual health/primary care clinics). Participants randomised were 99% women (3965 participants) with just 27 men. Half were Black, African or African‐American (1889 participants); 40% White/Caucasian (1530 participants); and 10% represented a range of other ethnic backgrounds (396 participants). The weighted mean age was 35.9 years (standard deviation (SD) 9.6). Eighty‐two per cent had experienced rape or sexual assault in adulthood (3260/3992). Twenty‐two studies (61%) required fulfilling a measured PTSD diagnostic threshold for inclusion; however, 94% of participants (2239/2370) were reported as having clinically relevant PTSD symptoms at entry. The comparison of psychosocial interventions with inactive controls detected that there may be a beneficial effect at post‐treatment favouring psychosocial interventions in reducing PTSD (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.22 to ‐0.44; 16 studies, 1130 participants; low‐certainty evidence; large effect size based on Cohen’s D); and depression (SMD ‐0.82, 95% CI ‐1.17 to ‐0.48; 12 studies, 901 participants; low‐certainty evidence; large effect size). Psychosocial interventions, however, may not increase the risk of dropout from treatment compared to controls, with a risk ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.44; 5 studies, 242 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Seven of the 23 studies (with 801 participants) comparing a psychosocial intervention to an inactive control reported on adverse events, with 21 events indicated. Psychosocial interventions may not increase the risk of adverse events compared to controls, with a risk ratio of 1.92 (95% CI 0.30 to 12.41; 6 studies; 622 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We conducted an assessment of risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool on a total of 49 reported results. A high risk of bias affected 43% of PTSD results; 59% for depression symptoms; 40% for treatment dropout; and one‐third for adverse events. The greatest sources of bias were problems with randomisation and missing outcome data. Heterogeneity was also high, ranging from I 2  = 30% (adverse events) to I 2  = 87% (PTSD). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOur review suggests that survivors of rape, sexual violence and sexual abuse during adulthood may experience a large reduction in post‐treatment PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms after experiencing a psychosocial intervention, relative to comparison groups. Psychosocial interventions do not seem to increase dropout from treatment or adverse events/effects compared to controls. However, the number of dropouts and study attrition were generally high, potentially missing harms of exposure to interventions and/or research participation. Also, the differential effects of specific intervention  types  needs further investigation. We conclude that a range of behavioural and CBT‐based interventions may improve the mental health of survivors of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse in the short term. Therefore, the needs and preferences of individuals must be considered in selecting suitable approaches to therapy and support. The primary outcome in this review focused on the post‐treatment period and the question about whether benefits are sustained over time persists. However, attaining such evidence from studies that lack an active comparison may be impractical and even unethical. Thus, we suggest that studies undertake head‐to‐head comparisons of different intervention types; in particular, of novel, emerging therapies, with one‐year plus follow‐up periods. Additionally, researchers should focus on the therapeutic benefits and costs for subpopulations such as male survivors and those living with complex PTSD.",

    "query": "Title: Psychosocial interventions for reducing antipsychotic medication in care home residents\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAntipsychotic medications are regularly prescribed in care home residents for the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) despite questionable efficacy, important adverse effects, and available non‐pharmacological interventions. Prescription rates are related to organisational factors, staff training and job satisfaction, patient characteristics, and specific interventions. Psychosocial intervention programmes aimed at reducing the prescription of antipsychotic drugs are available. These programmes may target care home residents (e.g. improving communication and interpersonal relationships) or target staff (e.g. by providing skills for caring for people with BPSD). Therefore, this review aimed to assess the effectiveness of these interventions, updating our earlier review published in 2012. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of psychosocial interventions to reduce antipsychotic medication use in care home residents compared to regular care, optimised regular care, or a different psychosocial intervention. \nSearch methods:\nWe used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 14 July 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included individual or cluster‐randomised controlled trials comparing a psychosocial intervention aimed primarily at reducing the use of antipsychotic medication with regular care, optimised regular care, or a different psychosocial intervention. Psychosocial interventions were defined as non‐pharmacological intervention with psychosocial components. We excluded medication withdrawal or substitution interventions, interventions without direct interpersonal contact and communication, and interventions solely addressing policy changes or structural interventions. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. Critical appraisal of studies addressed risks of selection, performance, attrition and detection bias, as well as criteria related to cluster randomisation. We retrieved data on the complex interventions on the basis of the TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) checklist. Our primary outcomes were 1. use of regularly prescribed antipsychotic medication and 2. adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. mortality; 4. BPSD; 5. quality of life; 6. prescribing of regularly psychotropic medication; 7. regimen of regularly prescribed antipsychotic medication; 8. antipsychotic medication administered 'as needed'; 9. physical restraints; 10. cognitive status; 11. depression; 12. activities of daily living; and 13. costs. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. \nMain results:\nWe included five cluster‐randomised controlled studies (120 clusters, 8342 participants). We found pronounced clinical heterogeneity and therefore decided to present study results narratively. All studies investigated complex interventions comprising, among other components, educational approaches. Because of the heterogeneity of the results, including the direction of effects, we are uncertain about the effects of psychosocial interventions on the prescription of antipsychotic medication. One study investigating an educational intervention for care home staff assessed the use of antipsychotic medication in days of use per 100 resident‐days, and found this to be lower in the intervention group (mean difference 6.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.05 to 6.66; 1152 participants). The other four studies reported the proportion of participants with a regular antipsychotic prescription. Of two studies implementing an intervention to promote person‐centred care, one found a difference in favour of the intervention group (between‐group difference 19.1%, 95% CI 0.5% to 37.7%; 338 participants), while the other found a difference in favour of the control group (between‐group difference 11.4%, 95% CI 0.9% to 21.9%; 862 participants). One study investigating an educational programme described as \"academic detailing\" found no difference between groups (odds ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.20; 5363 participants). The fifth study used a factorial design to compare different combinations of interventions to supplement person‐centred care. Results showed a positive effect of medication review, and no clear effect of social interaction or exercise. We considered that, overall, the evidence about this outcome was of low certainty. We found high‐certainty evidence that psychosocial interventions intended primarily to reduce antipsychotic use resulted in little to no difference in the number of falls, non‐elective hospitalisations, or unplanned emergency department visits. Psychosocial interventions intended primarily to reduce antipsychotic use also resulted in little to no difference in quality of life (moderate‐certainty evidence), and BPSD, regular prescribing of psychotropic medication, use of physical restraints, depression, or activities of daily living (all low‐certainty evidence). We also found low‐certainty evidence that, in the context of these interventions, social interaction and medication review may reduce mortality, but exercise does not. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nAll included interventions were complex and the components of the interventions differed considerably between studies. Interventions and intervention components were mostly not described in sufficient detail. Two studies found evidence that the complex psychosocial interventions may reduce antipsychotic medication use. In addition, one study showed that medication review might have some impact on antipsychotic prescribing rates. There were no important adverse events. Overall, the available evidence does not allow for clear generalisable recommendations.",
    "reference_answer": "For a complete set of scoring reference points regarding the main findings from the study \"Psychosocial interventions for reducing antipsychotic medication in care home residents,\" the following essential scoring criteria have been structured based on the abstract provided:\n\n- **Clinical Heterogeneity in Study Results:**\n  - Assessment of pronounced clinical heterogeneity among included studies.\n  - Evaluation of the direction and magnitude of effects across different studies.\n  - Consideration of narrative presentation of varied study results.\n\n- **Impact on Antipsychotic Medication Use:**\n  - Measurement of antipsychotic medication days of use per 100 resident-days compared between intervention and control groups.\n  - Evaluation of proportion of participants with regular antipsychotic prescriptions in studies assessing person-centred care.\n  - Comparison of odds ratios related to antipsychotic medication use in educational interventions.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Intervention Components:**\n  - Analysis of person-centred care interventions on medication prescribing rates.\n  - Assessment of \"academic detailing\" educational programme impacts on antipsychotic use.\n  - Examination of factorial design results for medication review, social interaction, and exercise.\n\n- **Certainty of Evidence:**\n  - Assessment of low-certainty evidence about psychosocial interventions' effects on antipsychotic medication use.\n  - Evaluation of high-certainty evidence regarding little to no differences in adverse events such as falls and hospitalisations.\n  - Appraisal of moderate-certainty evidence on quality of life outcomes.\n\n- **Additional Health and Lifestyle Outcomes:**\n  - Assessment of the psychosocial interventions' impact on BPSD, depression, cognitive status, and activities of daily living.\n  - Evaluation of psychotropic medication prescribing practices in the context of interventions.\n  - Analysis of low-certainty evidence concerning social interaction and medication review's influence on mortality.\n\n- **General Recommendations and Conclusions:**\n  - Identification of lack of detailed descriptions for intervention components.\n  - Recognition of complex nature of interventions and limited generalisable recommendations.\n  - Conclusion regarding minimal adverse events associated with interventions targeted at reducing antipsychotic use.\n\nThese criteria should assist in comprehensively evaluating the study's main findings with respect to scoring and determining effectiveness."

    "query": "Title: Specific psychological therapies versus other therapies or no treatment for severe and enduring anorexia nervosa\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAnorexia nervosa is a psychological condition characterised by self‐starvation and fear or wait gain or other body image disturbance. The first line of treatment is specific psychological therapy; however, there is no consensus on best practice for treating people who develop severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (SEAN). Notably, there is no universal definition of SEAN. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of specific psychological therapies for severe and enduring anorexia nervosa compared with other specific therapies, non‐specific therapies, no treatment/waiting list, antidepressant medication, dietary counselling alone, or treatment as usual. \nSearch methods:\nWe used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The last search date was 22 July 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people (any age) with anorexia nervosa of at least three years' duration. Eligible experimental interventions were any specific psychological therapy for improved physical and psychological health in anorexia nervosa, conducted in any treatment setting with no restrictions in terms of number of sessions, modality, or duration of therapy. Eligible comparator interventions included any other specific psychological therapy for anorexia nervosa, non‐specific psychological therapy for mental health disorders, no treatment or waiting list, antipsychotic treatment (with or without psychological therapy), antidepressant treatment (with or without psychological therapy), dietary counselling, and treatment as usual as defined by the individual trials. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were clinical improvement (weight restoration to within the normal weight range for participant sample) and treatment non‐completion. Results were presented using the GRADE appraisal tool. \nMain results:\nWe found two eligible studies, but only one study provided usable data. This was a parallel‐group RCT of 63 adults with SEAN who had an illness duration of at least seven years. The trial compared outpatient cognitive behaviour therapy for SEAN (CBT‐SEAN) with specialist supportive clinical management for SEAN (SSCM‐SE) over eight months. It is unclear if there is any difference between the effect of CBT‐SEAN versus SSCM‐SE on clinical improvement at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 3.05) or treatment non‐completion (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.59). There were no reported data on adverse effects. The trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. We rated the GRADE level of evidence as very low‐certainty for both primary outcomes, downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias concerns. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review reports evidence from one trial that evaluated CBT‐SEAN versus SSCM‐SE. There was very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference in clinical improvement and treatment non‐completion between the two therapies. There is a need for larger high‐quality trials to determine the benefits of specific psychological therapies for people with SEAN. These should take into account the duration of illness as well as participants' previous experience with evidence‐based psychological therapy for anorexia nervosa.",

    "query": "Title: Mental Health First Aid as a tool for improving mental health and well‐being\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nThe prevalence of mental health problems is high, and they have a wide‐ranging and deleterious effect on many sectors in society. As well as the impact on individuals and families, mental health problems in the workplace negatively affect productivity. One of the factors that may exacerbate the impact of mental health problems is a lack of 'mental health literacy' in the general population. This has been defined as 'knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders, which aid their recognition, management, or prevention'. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a brief training programme developed in Australia in 2000; its aim is to improve mental health literacy and teach mental health first aid strategies. The course has been adapted for various contexts, but essentially covers the symptoms of various mental health disorders, along with associated mental health crisis situations. The programmes also teach trainees how to provide immediate help to people experiencing mental health difficulties, as well as how to signpost to professional services. It is theorised that improved knowledge will encourage the trainees to provide support, and encourage people to actively seek help, thereby leading to improvements in mental health. This review focuses on the effects of MHFA on the mental health and mental well‐being of individuals and communities in which MHFA training has been provided. We also examine the impact on mental health literacy. This information is essential for decision‐makers considering the role of MHFA training in their organisations. \nObjectives:\nTo examine mental health and well‐being, mental health service usage, and adverse effects of MHFA training on individuals in the communities in which MHFA training is delivered. \nSearch methods:\nWe developed a sensitive search strategy to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MHFA training. This approach used bibliographic databases searching, using a search strategy developed for Ovid MEDLINE (1946 ‐), and translated across to Ovid Embase (1974 ‐), Ovid PsycINFO (1967 ‐), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialised Register (CCMDCTR). We also searched online clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP), grey literature and reference lists of included studies, and contacted researchers in the field to identify additional and ongoing studies. Searches are current to 13th June 2023. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included RCTs and cluster‐RCTs comparing any type of MHFA‐trademarked course to no intervention, active or attention control (such as first aid courses), waiting list control, or alternative mental health literacy interventions. Participants were individuals in the communities in which MHFA training is delivered and MHFA trainees. Primary outcomes included mental health and well‐being of individuals, mental health service usage and adverse effects of MHFA training. Secondary outcomes related to individuals, MHFA trainees, and communities or organisations in which MHFA training has been delivered \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. We analysed categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We pooled data using a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently assessed the key results using the Risk of Bias 2 tool and applied the GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of evidence \nMain results:\nTwenty‐one studies involving a total of 22,604 participants were included in the review. Fifteen studies compared MHFA training with no intervention/waiting list, two studies compared MHFA training with an alternative mental health literacy intervention, and four studies compared MHFA training with an active or an attention control intervention. Our primary time point was between six and 12 months. When MHFA training was compared with no intervention, it may have little to no effect on the mental health of individuals at six to 12 months, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.28; 3 studies; 3939 participants). We judged all the results that contributed to this outcome as being at high risk of bias. No study measured mental health service usage at six to 12 months. We did not find published data on adverse effects. Only one study with usable data compared MHFA training with an alternative mental health literacy intervention. The study did not measure outcomes in individuals in the community. It also did not measure outcomes at our primary time point of six to 12 months. Four studies with usable data compared MHFA training to an active or attention control. None of the studies measured outcomes at our primary time point of six to 12 months. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe cannot draw conclusions about the effects of MHFA training on our primary outcomes due to the lack of good quality evidence. This is the case whether it is compared to no intervention, to an alternative mental health literacy intervention, or to an active control. Studies are at high risk of bias and often not sufficiently large to be able to detect differences.",
    "reference_answer": "Scoring Reference Points for Main Findings:\n\n- **Impact on Mental Health (6-12 months)**: When MHFA training is compared to no intervention, it may have little to no effect on the mental health of individuals at six to 12 months. Evidence provided is very uncertain due to high risk of bias in the studies.\n\n- **Mental Health Service Usage**: No study has adequately measured mental health service usage at six to 12 months following MHFA training. This reflects a gap in the evidence base.\n\n- **Adverse Effects Data**: No published data on adverse effects were identified, leaving a significant knowledge gap regarding the potential unintended consequences of MHFA training.\n\n- **Comparison with Alternative Programs**: There is limited data available when comparing MHFA training with alternative mental health literacy interventions or active/control interventions, and outcomes were not measured consistently at the primary time point.\n\n- **Overall Quality of Evidence**: The studies reviewed were often at high risk of bias and not sufficiently large to detect differences, limiting the ability to draw conclusive effects of MHFA training on primary outcomes.\n\n- **Recommendation for Future Research**: Increased focus on reducing risk of bias, enhancing sample size, and addressing specific measurement of mental health service usage and adverse effects to improve evidence reliability.\n\nThese criteria offer a comprehensive framework to evaluate the findings regarding MHFA training's impact on mental health and service usage, underscoring areas where data is lacking or uncertain."

    "query": "Title: Dance movement therapy for dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDementia is a syndrome of acquired cognitive impairment which is severe enough to interfere with independent living. Over the course of the illness, people with dementia also experience changes in emotions, behaviour and social relationships. According to Alzheimer's Disease International, dementia affects approximately 55 million people worldwide. The latest NICE guideline for dementia highlights the value of diverse treatment options for the different stages and symptoms of dementia, including non‐pharmacological treatments. Relevant literature also argues for the value of interventions that acknowledge the complexity of the condition and address the person as a whole, including their physical, emotional, social and cognitive processes. A growing literature highlights the capacity of the arts and has embodied practices to address this complexity. Dance movement therapy (DMT) is an embodied psychological intervention that can address complexity and thus may be useful for people with dementia, but its effectiveness remains unclear. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of dance movement therapy on behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional symptoms of people with dementia in comparison to no treatment, standard care or any other treatment. Also, to compare different forms of dance movement therapy (e.g. Laban‐based dance movement therapy, Chacian dance movement therapy or Authentic Movement) \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register of the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal until 8 December 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included people with dementia, of any age and in any setting. The DMT intervention had to be delivered by a dance movement therapy practitioner who (i) had received formal training (ii) was a dance movement therapist in training or (iii) was otherwise recognised as a dance movement therapist in the country in which the study was conducted. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. We expressed effect estimates using the mean difference (MD) between intervention groups and presented associated confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to rate our certainty in the results. \nMain results:\nWe found only one study eligible for inclusion in this review. This was a 3‐arm parallel‐group RCT conducted in Hong Kong involving 204 adults with mild neurocognitive disorder or dementia. The study examined the effects of short‐term (12 weeks) group DMT in comparison with exercise and a waiting‐list control group immediately post‐intervention and three and nine months later. We found that, at the end of the intervention, DMT may result in little to no difference in neuropsychiatric symptoms assessed with the 12‐item Neuropsychiatric Inventory when compared with waiting list (MD 0.3, 95% CI ‐0.96 to 1.56; low‐certainty evidence) or exercise (MD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐1.83 to 1.23; low‐certainty evidence). Nor was there any evidence of effects at later time points. Cognitive functioning was assessed with a variety of instruments and there were no statistically significant between‐group differences (low‐certainty evidence). When compared to exercise or waiting list, DMT may result in little to no difference in cognitive function immediately after the intervention or at follow‐up. In comparison to waiting list, DMT may result in a slight reduction in depression assessed with the 4‐item Geriatric Depression Scale at the end of therapy (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐0.96 to ‐0.24; low‐certainty evidence). This slight positive effect of DMT on depression scores was sustained at three and nine months after the completion of the intervention. DMT may also reduce depression slightly in comparison with exercise at the end of therapy (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐0.76 to ‐0.04, low‐certainty evidence), an effect also sustained at three and nine months. Our fourth primary outcome, quality of life, was not assessed in the included study. There were data for two of our secondary outcomes, social and occupational functioning and dropouts (which we used as a proxy for acceptability), but in both cases the evidence was of very low certainty and hence our confidence in the results was very low. For all outcomes, we considered the certainty of the evidence in relation to our review objectives to be low or very low in GRADE terms due to indirectness (because not all participants in the included study had a diagnosis of dementia) and imprecision. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review included one RCT with a low risk of bias. Due to the low certainty of the evidence, the true effects of DMT as an intervention for dementia may be substantially different from those found. More RCTs are needed to determine with any confidence whether DMT has beneficial effects on dementia.",
    "reference_answer": "To generate a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings of the dance movement therapy (DMT) study on dementia, we'll break down each essential aspect for evaluation:\n\n- **Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Improvement:**\n  - Score the evidence for improvement as 'low-certainty.'\n  - Assess outcomes in comparison to both waiting list and exercise groups.\n  - Note any effects both immediately after intervention and at follow-up.\n\n- **Cognitive Functioning Differences:**\n  - Evaluate absence of significant differences across groups.\n  - Rate evidence certainty as 'low.'\n\n- **Depression Reduction:**\n  - Score depression reduction when comparing DMT to waiting list and exercise, highlighting slight improvement.\n  - Evaluate sustainability of this effect over follow-ups.\n  - Consider the certainty of evidence as 'low.'\n\n- **Quality of Life Assessment:**\n  - Record the lack of assessment for quality of life in the included study.\n\n- **Social and Occupational Functioning Evidence:**\n  - Evaluate very low certainty levels for findings.\n  - Score outcomes with a focus on evidence quality.\n\n- **Acceptability via Dropouts:**\n  - Use dropout rates as a proxy for intervention acceptability.\n  - Consider the very low certainty of this evidence in scoring.\n\n- **Overall Evidence Certainty:**\n  - Emphasize the general low to very low certainty in GRADE terms.\n  - Acknowledge indirectness due to participant diagnoses and imprecision.\n\nEach bullet point represents a criterion to be used when scoring and evaluating the findings of the DMT study in the context of treating dementia symptoms."

This systematic review of the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints outside hospital settings, i.e. in care homes and the community, updates our previous review published in 2011. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effects of interventions to prevent and reduce the use of physical restraints for older people who require long‐term care (either at home or in residential care facilities) \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register, the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal, on 3 August 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that investigated the effects of interventions intended to prevent or reduce the use of physical restraints in older people who require long‐term care. Studies conducted in residential care institutions or in the community, including patients' homes, were eligible for inclusion. We assigned all included interventions to categories based on their mechanisms and components. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently selected the publications for inclusion, extracted study data, and assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. Primary outcomes were the number or proportion of people with at least one physical restraint, and serious adverse events related to PR use, such as death or serious injuries. We performed meta‐analyses if necessary data were available. If meta‐analyses were not feasible, we reported results narratively. We used GRADE methods to describe the certainty of the evidence. \nMain results:\nWe identified six new studies and included 11 studies with 19,003 participants in this review update. All studies were conducted in long‐term residential care facilities. Ten studies were RCTs and one study a CCT. All studies included people with dementia. The mean age of the participants was approximately 85 years. Four studies investigated organisational interventions aiming to implement a least‐restraint policy; six studies investigated simple educational interventions; and one study tested an intervention that provided staff with information about residents' fall risk. The control groups received usual care only in most studies although, in two studies, additional information materials about physical restraint reduction were provided. We judged the risk of selection bias to be high or unclear in eight studies. Risk of reporting bias was high in one study and unclear in eight studies. The organisational interventions intended to promote a least‐restraint policy included a variety of components, such as education of staff, training of 'champions' of low‐restraint practice, and components which aimed to facilitate a change in institutional policies and culture of care. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that organisational interventions aimed at implementation of a least‐restraint policy probably lead to a reduction in the number of residents with at least one use of PR (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94; 3849 participants, 4 studies) and a large reduction in the number of residents with at least one use of a belt for restraint (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73; 2711 participants, 3 studies). No adverse events occurred in the one study which reported this outcome. There was evidence from one study that organisational interventions probably reduce the duration of physical restraint use. We found that the interventions may have little or no effect on the number of falls or fall‐related injuries (low‐certainty evidence) and probably have little or no effect on the number of prescribed psychotropic medications (moderate‐certainty evidence). One study found that organisational interventions result in little or no difference in quality of life (high‐certainty evidence) and another study found that they may make little or no difference to agitation (low‐certainty evidence). The simple educational interventions were intended to increase knowledge and change staff attitudes towards PR. As well as providing education, some interventions included further components to support change, such as ward‐based guidance. We found pronounced between‐group baseline imbalances in PR prevalence in some of the studies, which might have occurred because of the small number of clusters in the intervention and control groups. One study did not assess bedrails, which is the most commonly used method of restraint in nursing homes. Regarding the number of residents with at least one restraint, the results were inconsistent. We found very‐low certainty evidence and we are uncertain about the effects of simple educational interventions on the number of residents with PR. None of the studies assessed or reported any serious adverse events. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that simple educational interventions probably result in little or no difference in restraint intensity and may have little or no effect on falls, fall‐related injuries, or agitation (low‐certainty evidence each). Based on very low‐certainty evidence we are uncertain about the effects of simple educational interventions on the number of participants with a prescription of at least one psychotropic medication. One study investigated an intervention that provided information about residents' fall risk to the nursing staff. We found low‐certainty evidence that providing information about residents' fall risk may result in little or no difference in the mean number of PR or the number of falls. The study did not assess overall adverse events. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOrganisational interventions aimed to implement a least‐restraint policy probably reduce the number of residents with at least one PR and probably largely reduce the number of residents with at least one belt. We are uncertain whether simple educational interventions reduce the use of physical restraints, and interventions providing information about residents' fall risk may result in little to no difference in the use of physical restraints. These results apply to long‐term care institutions; we found no studies from community settings.",

    "query": "Title: Cognitive behavioural therapy plus standard care versus standard care for persistent aggressive behaviour or agitation in people with schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSchizophrenia and other psychoses are thought to be associated with a substantial increase in aggressive behaviour, violence and violent offending. However, acts of aggression or violence committed by people with severe mental illness are rare and circumscribed to a small minority of individuals. We know little about the frequency and variability of violent episodes for people with schizophrenia who present chronic or recurrent aggressive episodes, and of available interventions to reduce such problems. A psychological intervention, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), aims to challenge dysfunctional thoughts and has been used since the mid‐1970s to improve mental health and emotional disorders. CBT includes different interventional procedures, such as cognitive therapy, elements of behavioural therapy, problem‐solving interventions, and coping skills training, among others. Although CBT presents much diversity, interventions are characteristically problem‐focused, goal‐directed, future‐oriented, time‐limited (about 12 to 20 sessions over four to six months), and empirically based. CBT has shown clinically beneficial effects in persistent positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and its use as an add‐on therapy to medication in the treatment of schizophrenia is supported by treatment guidelines. However, several Cochrane Reviews recently concluded that, due to the low quality of evidence available, no firm conclusions can currently be made regarding the effectiveness of adding CBT to standard care for people with schizophrenia, or about CBT compared to other psychosocial treatments for people with schizophrenia. Whereas CBT is not an emergency or crisis intervention that acts immediately on the known or unknown triggers underlying aggressive behaviour, might be a timely treatment used to manage persistent aggression or repeated aggressive episodes in people with schizophrenia. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of cognitive behavioural therapy(CBT) plus standard care versus standard care alone for people with schizophrenia and persistent aggression. \nSearch methods:\nOn 18 January 2023, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials which is based on CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and WHO ICTRP. We also inspected references of all identified studies for more studies. \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised controlled trials comparing CBT plus standard care with standard care alone for people with schizophrenia and persistent aggression. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated mean differences (MD) and their 95%CIs for outcomes reported with the same measurement scale. Post hoc, for counts over person‐time outcomes, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95%CIs. If feasible, we combined study outcomes with the random‐effects model. We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and created a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included two studies with 184 participants with psychotic disorder (mainly schizophrenia) and violence. The studies were run in forensic units and prison. Both studies were at high risk of bias on blinding (performance and detection bias). CBT plus standard care as compared with standard care may result in little to no difference in the frequency of physical violence at end of trial (IRR 0.52; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.18) and follow‐up (IRR 0.86; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.68). The confidence interval did not exclude the null effect, and the certainty of the evidence is very low due to lack of blinding and to the small sample size. One study reported no deaths in both arms and zero serious and other adverse events. The other study did not report any figure for deaths or adverse events. CBT plus standard care as compared with standard care may result in little to no difference in leaving the study early for any reason (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.53 to 2.00). Confidence interval did not exclude the null effect and the certainty of the evidence is low due to lack of blinding and the small sample size. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWhereas the evidence from only two studies with 184 participants suggests the use of CBT plus standard care may reduce some aggressive behaviours in patients with schizophrenia, the grading of the certainty of the evidence is very low. It implies that there is not yet reliable evidence to guide clinical decisions and therefore more evidence is needed to get a more precise estimate of the effect of the intervention. Currently, we have very little confidence in the effect estimate, and the true effect could be substantially different from its estimate.",

    "query": "Title: Pharmacological, non���invasive brain stimulation and psychological interventions, and their combination, for treating depression after stroke\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDepression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts on recovery, yet is often undetected or inadequately treated. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological intervention, non‐invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these to treat depression after stroke. \nSearch methods:\nThis is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every two months and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. We searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke, and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, two clinical trials registers, reference lists and conference proceedings (February 2022). We contacted study authors. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: 1) pharmacological interventions with placebo; 2) non‐invasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation or usual care; 3) psychological therapy with usual care or attention control; 4) pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with pharmacological intervention and usual care or attention control; 5) pharmacological intervention and non‐invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention and sham stimulation or usual care; 6) non‐invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus sham brain stimulation or usual care and psychological therapy; 7) pharmacological intervention and psychological therapy with placebo and psychological therapy; 8) pharmacological intervention and non‐invasive brain stimulation with placebo and non‐invasive brain stimulation; and 9) non‐invasive brain stimulation and psychological therapy versus non‐invasive brain stimulation and usual care or attention control, with the intention of treating depression after stroke. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from included studies. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I² statistic and certainty of the evidence according to GRADE. \nMain results:\nWe included 65 trials (72 comparisons) with 5831 participants. Data were available for: 1) 20 comparisons; 2) nine comparisons; 3) 25 comparisons; 4) three comparisons; 5) 14 comparisons; and 6) one comparison. We found no trials for comparisons 7 to 9. Comparison 1: Pharmacological interventions  Very low‐certainty evidence from eight trials suggests pharmacological interventions decreased the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; P = 0.002; 8 RCTs; 1025 participants) at end of treatment and very low‐certainty evidence from six trials suggests that pharmacological interventions decreased the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.70; P = 0.0002; 6 RCTs; 511 participants) compared to placebo. More adverse events related to the central nervous system (CNS) (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.15; P = 0.008; 5 RCTs; 488 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and gastrointestinal system (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.19; P = 0.002; 4 RCTs; 473 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) were noted in the pharmacological intervention than in the placebo group. Comparison 2: Non‐invasive brain stimulation  Very low‐certainty evidence from two trials show that non‐invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.14; P = 0.14; 2 RCTs; 130 participants) and the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52, 1.37; P = 0.49; 2 RCTs; 130 participants) compared to sham stimulation. Non‐invasive brain stimulation resulted in no deaths. Comparison 3: Psychological therapy  Very low‐certainty evidence from six trials suggests that psychological therapy decreased the number of people meeting the study criteria for depression at end of treatment (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; P = 0.01; 521 participants) compared to usual care/attention control. No trials of psychological therapy reported on the outcome inadequate response to treatment. No differences in the number of deaths or adverse events were found in the psychological therapy group compared to the usual care/attention control group. Comparison 4: Pharmacological interventions with psychological therapy  No trials of this combination reported on the primary outcomes. Combination therapy resulted in no deaths. Comparison 5: Pharmacological interventions with non‐invasive brain stimulation  Non‐invasive brain stimulation with pharmacological intervention reduced the number of people meeting study criteria for depression at end of treatment (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91; P = 0.002; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but not the number of people with inadequate response to treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; P = 0.75; 3 RCTs; 392 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to pharmacological therapy alone. Very low‐certainty evidence from five trials suggest no difference in deaths between this combination therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.16; P = 0.93; 487 participants) compared to pharmacological therapy intervention and sham stimulation or usual care. Comparison 6: Non‐invasive brain stimulation with psychological therapy  No trials of this combination reported on the primary outcomes. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nVery low‐certainty evidence suggests that pharmacological, psychological and combination therapies can reduce the prevalence of depression while non‐invasive brain stimulation had little to no effect on the prevalence of depression. Pharmacological intervention was associated with adverse events related to the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments.",

    "query": "Title: Cognitive rehabilitation for people with mild to moderate dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nCognitive impairments affect functional ability in people with dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) is a personalised, solution‐focused approach that aims to enable people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia to manage everyday activities and maintain as much independence as possible. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild‐to‐moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, which contains records from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and other clinical trial databases, and grey literature sources. The most recent search was completed on 19 October 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CR with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia and/or the care partner. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and contacted trial authors if necessary. Within each of the comparisons, we pooled data for each outcome of interest and conducted inverse‐variance, random‐effects meta‐analyses. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADEpro GDT. \nMain results:\nWe identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions.  Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self‐rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self‐rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium‐term follow‐up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high‐quality RCT.  We found high‐certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self‐ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I 2  = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I 2  = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self‐ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I 2  = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium‐term follow‐up, we found high‐certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self‐ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I 2  = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I 2  = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self‐ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I 2  = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self‐efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium‐term follow‐up we found moderate‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants).  We found moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium‐term follow‐up on participant self‐efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners).  For care partners at medium‐term follow‐up we found high‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate‐certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate‐ and low‐certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners’ physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium‐term follow‐up for the physical health aspect of care partners’ quality of life and psychological wellbeing. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nCR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high‐quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.",

    "query": "Title: Magnetic seizure therapy for people with schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSchizophrenia is one of the most common and disabling mental disorders. About 20% of people with schizophrenia do not respond to antipsychotics, which are the mainstay of the treatment for schizophrenia today, and need to seek other treatment options. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is one of the novel non‐invasive brain stimulation techniques that are being investigated in recent years.  \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MST for people with schizophrenia. \nSearch methods:\nOn 6 March 2022, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials which is based on CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and WHO ICTRP. \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MST alone or plus standard care with ECT or any other interventions for people with schizophrenia.  \nData collection and analysis:\nWe performed reference screening, study selection, data extraction and risk of bias and quality assessment in duplicate. We calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for binary outcomes and the mean difference (MD) and their 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We used the original risk of bias tool for risk of bias assessment and created a Summary of findings table using GRADE. \nMain results:\nWe included one four‐week study with 79 adults in acute schizophrenia, comparing MST plus standard care to ECT plus standard care in this review. We rated the overall risk of bias as high due to high risk of bias in the domains of selective reporting and other biases (early termination and baseline imbalance) and unclear risk of bias in the domain of blinding of participants and personnel. We found that MST and ECT may not differ in improving the global state (n = 79, risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.70), overall (n = 79, mean difference (MD) ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐8.08 to 7.68), the positive symptoms (n = 79, MD 1.40, 95% CI ‐1.97 to 4.77) and the negative symptoms (n = 79, MD ‐1.00, 95% CI ‐3.85 to 1.85) in people with schizophrenia.  We found  that MST compared to ECT may cause less delayed memory deficit and less cognitive deterioration (n = 79, number of people with a delayed memory deficit, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96; n = 79, mean change in global cognitive function, MD 5.80, 95% CI 0.80 to 10.80), but also may improve more cognitive function (n = 47, number of people with any cognitive improvement, RR 3.30, 95% CI 1.29 to 8.47).  We found that there may be no difference between the two groups in terms of leaving the study early due to any reason (n = 79, RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.73 to 8.59), due to adverse effects (n = 79, RR 3.35, 95% CI 0.39 to 28.64) or due to inefficacy (n = 79, RR 2.52, 95% CI 0.11 to 60.10).  Since all findings were based on one study with high risk of bias and the confidence in the evidence was very low, we were not sure these comparable or favourable effects of MST over ECT were its true effects.  \nAuthors' conclusions:\nDue to the paucity of data, we cannot draw any conclusion on the efficacy and tolerability of MST for people with schizophrenia. Well‐designed RCTs are warranted to answer the question.",
    "reference_answer": "Here are the scoring reference points for the main findings based on the given abstract:\n\n- **Participant Count:**\n  - The study included 79 participants diagnosed with acute schizophrenia.\n\n- **Global State Improvement:**\n  - MST and ECT showed no significant difference in improving the global state of individuals with schizophrenia (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.70).\n\n- **Symptom Improvement:**\n  - No significant difference was found between MST and ECT in improving overall symptoms (MD -0.20, 95% CI -8.08 to 7.68), positive symptoms (MD 1.40, 95% CI -1.97 to 4.77), or negative symptoms (MD -1.00, 95% CI -3.85 to 1.85).\n\n- **Cognitive Functioning:**\n  - MST may have advantages over ECT concerning cognitive functioning:\n    - MST potentially causes less delayed memory deficit compared to ECT (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96).\n    - MST may result in less cognitive deterioration (mean change in global cognitive function, MD 5.80, 95% CI 0.80 to 10.80).\n    - MST may improve cognitive function more than ECT (RR 3.30, 95% CI 1.29 to 8.47).\n\n- **Study Attrition:**\n  - No significant difference was observed between MST and ECT in participants leaving the study early due to any reason (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.73 to 8.59), adverse effects (RR 3.35, 95% CI 0.39 to 28.64), or inefficacy (RR 2.52, 95% CI 0.11 to 60.10).\n\n- **Confidence in Evidence:**\n  - Due to high risk of bias and very low confidence in the evidence from a single study, the effects of MST compared to ECT were uncertain.\n\n- **Authors’ Conclusions:**\n  - Due to the limited data from one study, conclusions on the efficacy and tolerability of MST for schizophrenia were not definitive, indicating the need for well-designed RCTs for further investigation."

    "query": "Title: Individual‐level interventions for reducing occupational stress in healthcare workers\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nHealthcare workers can suffer from work‐related stress as a result of an imbalance of demands, skills and social support at work. This may lead to stress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration of service provision. This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was last updated in 2015, which has been split into this review and a review on organisational‐level interventions.  \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of stress‐reduction interventions targeting individual healthcare workers compared to no intervention, wait list, placebo, no stress‐reduction intervention or another type of stress‐reduction intervention in reducing stress symptoms.  \nSearch methods:\nWe used the previous version of the review as one source of studies (search date: November 2013). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and a trials register from 2013 up to February 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of stress interventions directed at healthcare workers. We included only interventions targeted at individual healthcare workers aimed at reducing stress symptoms.  \nData collection and analysis:\nReview authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We categorised interventions into ones that: 1. focus one’s attention  on  the (modification of the) experience of stress (thoughts, feelings, behaviour);  2. focus one’s attention  away  from the experience of stress by various means of psychological disengagement (e.g. relaxing, exercise);  3. alter work‐related risk factors on an individual level; and ones that 4. combine two or more of the above.  The crucial outcome measure was stress symptoms measured with various self‐reported questionnaires such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), measured at short term (up to and including three months after the intervention ended), medium term (> 3 to 12 months after the intervention ended), and long term follow‐up (> 12 months after the intervention ended).  \nMain results:\nThis is the second update of the original Cochrane Review published in 2006, Issue 4. This review update includes 89 new studies, bringing the total number of studies in the current review to 117 with a total of 11,119 participants randomised.  The number of participants per study arm was ≥ 50 in 32 studies. The most important risk of bias was the lack of blinding of participants.  Focus on the experience of stress versus no intervention/wait list/placebo/no stress‐reduction intervention Fifty‐two studies studied an intervention in which one's focus is on the experience of stress. Overall, such interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.52 to ‐0.23; 41 RCTs; 3645 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and medium term (SMD ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.71 to ‐0.14; 19 RCTs; 1851 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The SMD of the short‐term result translates back to 4.6 points fewer on the MBI‐emotional exhaustion scale (MBI‐EE, a scale from 0 to 54). The evidence is very uncertain (one RCT; 68 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) about the long‐term effect on stress symptoms of focusing one's attention on the experience of stress. Focus away from the experience of stress versus no intervention/wait list/placebo/no stress‐reduction intervention  Forty‐two studies studied an intervention in which one's focus is away from the experience of stress. Overall, such interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms in the short term (SMD ‐0.55, 95 CI ‐0.70 to ‐0.40; 35 RCTs; 2366 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and medium term (SMD ‐0.41 95% CI ‐0.79 to ‐0.03; 6 RCTs; 427 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The SMD on the short term translates back to 6.8 fewer points on the MBI‐EE. No studies reported the long‐term effect. Focus on work‐related, individual‐level factors versus no intervention/no stress‐reduction intervention Seven studies studied an intervention in which the focus is on altering work‐related factors. The evidence is very uncertain about the short‐term effects (no pooled effect estimate; three RCTs; 87 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and medium‐term effects and long‐term effects (no pooled effect estimate; two RCTs; 152 participants, and one RCT; 161 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) of this type of stress management intervention.  A combination of individual‐level interventions versus no intervention/wait list/no stress‐reduction intervention Seventeen studies studied a combination of interventions. In the short‐term, this type of intervention may result in a reduction in stress symptoms (SMD ‐0.67 95%, CI ‐0.95 to ‐0.39; 15 RCTs; 1003 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The SMD translates back to 8.2 fewer points on the MBI‐EE. On the medium term, a combination of individual‐level interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms, but the evidence does not exclude no effect (SMD ‐0.48, 95% CI ‐0.95 to 0.00; 6 RCTs; 574 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the long term effects of a combination of interventions on stress symptoms (one RCT, 88 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Focus on stress versus other intervention type  Three studies compared focusing on stress versus focusing away from stress and one study a combination of interventions versus focusing on stress. The evidence is very uncertain about which type of intervention is better or if their effect is similar. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOur review shows that there may be an effect on stress reduction in healthcare workers from individual‐level stress interventions, whether they focus one's attention on or away from the experience of stress. This effect may last up to a year after the end of the intervention. A combination of interventions may be beneficial as well, at least in the short term. Long‐term effects of individual‐level stress management interventions remain unknown. The same applies for interventions on (individual‐level) work‐related risk factors. The bias assessment of the studies in this review showed the need for methodologically better‐designed and executed studies, as nearly all studies suffered from poor reporting of the randomisation procedures, lack of blinding of participants and lack of trial registration. Better‐designed trials with larger sample sizes are required to increase the certainty of the evidence. Last, there is a need for more studies on interventions which focus on work‐related risk factors.",
    "reference_answer": "Here is a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings based on the psychiatry abstract and the full-score versions provided:\n\n- **Individual-Level Effectiveness**: \n  - Rate the perceived reduction in stress symptoms in healthcare workers using individual-level interventions, considering evidence of low certainty (e.g., high, moderate, low).\n\n- **Focus on Experience of Stress**: \n  - Measure the short-term effectiveness (up to 3 months) of interventions focusing on stress experience using standardized mean difference (SMD -0.37) with low certainty. \n  - Assess the medium-term effectiveness (3 to 12 months) with evidence translating to an SMD of -0.43, noting low certainty.\n\n- **Focus Away from Stress**:\n  - Evaluate the short-term (up to 3 months) effectiveness of interventions focusing away from stress, with reported SMD of -0.55 and low certainty.\n  - Determine the medium-term (3 to 12 months) impact with an SMD of -0.41, noting low certainty.\n\n- **Altering Work-Related Risk Factors**:\n  - Assess the evidence presented for altering work-related risk factors and classify the certainty level (e.g., very low) regarding its effectiveness.\n\n- **Combination of Interventions**:\n  - Rate the short-term reduction in stress symptoms using a combination of interventions, with an SMD of -0.67 and low-certainty evidence.\n  - Measure the evidence for medium-term benefits, focusing on SMD values cited as potentially conflicting (e.g., SMD -0.48) and noting the low certainty.\n  - Consider long-term effects as unknown; classify evidence certainty for future studies.\n\n- **Long-Term Effects**:\n  - Recognize that the long-term effectiveness of individual-level interventions remains unknown, and rate the potential need for more robust evidence accordingly.\n\n- **Comparison of Intervention Types**:\n  - Examine the uncertainty surrounding the relative effectiveness of focusing on stress versus focusing away from stress, highlighting very low certainty evidence.\n\nThese scoring reference points consider the primary findings from the abstract to facilitate the evaluation of interventions based on evidence strength and potential implications for practice."

    "query": "Title: Interventions from pregnancy to two years after birth for parents experiencing complex post‐traumatic stress disorder and/or with childhood experience of maltreatment\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAcceptable, effective and feasible support strategies (interventions) for parents experiencing complex post‐traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) symptoms or with a history of childhood maltreatment may offer an opportunity to support parental recovery, reduce the risk of intergenerational transmission of trauma and improve life‐course trajectories for children and future generations. However, evidence relating to the effect of interventions has not been synthesised to provide a comprehensive review of available support strategies. This evidence synthesis is critical to inform further research, practice and policy approaches in this emerging area. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of interventions provided to support parents who were experiencing CPTSD symptoms or who had experienced childhood maltreatment (or both), on parenting capacity and parental psychological or socio‐emotional wellbeing. \nSearch methods:\nIn October 2021 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases and two trials registers, together with checking references and contacting experts to identify additional studies. \nSelection criteria:\nAll variants of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any intervention delivered in the perinatal period designed to support parents experiencing CPTSD symptoms or with a history of childhood maltreatment (or both), to any active or inactive control. Primary outcomes were parental psychological or socio‐emotional wellbeing and parenting capacity between pregnancy and up to two years postpartum. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials for inclusion, extracted data using a pre‐designed data extraction form, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence. We contacted study authors for additional information as required. We analysed continuous data using mean difference (MD) for outcomes using a single measure, and standardised mean difference (SMD) for outcomes using multiple measures, and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data. All data are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We undertook meta‐analyses using random‐effects models. \nMain results:\nWe included evidence from 1925 participants in 15 RCTs that investigated the effect of 17 interventions. All included studies were published after 2005. Interventions included seven parenting interventions, eight psychological interventions and two service system approaches. The studies were funded by major research councils, government departments and philanthropic/charitable organisations. All evidence was of low or very low certainty. Parenting interventions Evidence was very uncertain from a study (33 participants) assessing the effects of a parenting intervention compared to attention control on trauma‐related symptoms, and psychological wellbeing symptoms (postpartum depression), in mothers who had experienced childhood maltreatment and were experiencing current parenting risk factors. Evidence suggested that parenting interventions may improve parent‐child relationships slightly compared to usual service provision (SMD 0.45, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.96; I 2  = 60%; 2 studies, 153 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between parenting interventions and usual perinatal service in parenting skills including nurturance, supportive presence and reciprocity (SMD 0.25, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.58; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 149 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of parenting interventions on parents' substance use, relationship quality or self‐harm. Psychological interventions Psychological interventions may result in little or no difference in trauma‐related symptoms compared to usual care (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 0.31; I 2  = 39%; 4 studies, 247 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Psychological interventions may make little or no difference compared to usual care to depression symptom severity (8 studies, 507 participants, low‐certainty evidence, SMD ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.66 to ‐0.03; I 2  = 63%). An interpersonally focused cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy may slightly increase the number of pregnant women who quit smoking compared to usual smoking cessation therapy and prenatal care (189 participants, low‐certainty evidence). A psychological intervention may slightly improve parents' relationship quality compared to usual care (1 study, 67 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Benefits for parent‐child relationships were very uncertain (26 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), while there may be a slight improvement in parenting skills compared to usual care (66 participants, low‐certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of psychological interventions on parents' self‐harm. Service system approaches One service system approach assessed the effect of a financial empowerment education programme, with and without trauma‐informed peer support, compared to usual care for parents with low incomes. The interventions increased depression slightly (52 participants, low‐certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of service system interventions on parents' trauma‐related symptoms, substance use, relationship quality, self‐harm, parent‐child relationships or parenting skills. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is currently a lack of high‐quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to improve parenting capacity or parental psychological or socio‐emotional wellbeing in parents experiencing CPTSD symptoms or who have experienced childhood maltreatment (or both). This lack of methodological rigour and high risk of bias made it difficult to interpret the findings of this review. Overall, results suggest that parenting interventions may slightly improve parent‐child relationships but have a small, unimportant effect on parenting skills. Psychological interventions may help some women stop smoking in pregnancy, and may have small benefits on parents' relationships and parenting skills. A financial empowerment programme may slightly worsen depression symptoms. While potential beneficial effects were small, the importance of a positive effect in a small number of parents must be considered when making treatment and care decisions. There is a need for further high‐quality research into effective strategies for this population.",

    "query": "Title: Antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people with cancer\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMajor depression and other depressive conditions are common in people with cancer. These conditions are not easily detectable in clinical practice, due to the overlap between medical and psychiatric symptoms, as described by diagnostic manuals such as the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM) and  International Classification of Diseases  (ICD). Moreover, it is particularly challenging to distinguish between pathological and normal reactions to such a severe illness. Depressive symptoms, even in subthreshold manifestations, have a negative impact in terms of quality of life, compliance with anticancer treatment, suicide risk and possibly the mortality rate for the cancer itself. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants in this population are few and often report conflicting results. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants for treating depressive symptoms in adults (aged 18 years or older) with cancer (any site and stage). \nSearch methods:\nWe used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was November 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included RCTs comparing antidepressants versus placebo, or antidepressants versus other antidepressants, in adults (aged 18 years or above) with any primary diagnosis of cancer and depression (including major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, dysthymic disorder or depressive symptoms in the absence of a formal diagnosis). \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. efficacy as a continuous outcome. Our secondary outcomes were 2. efficacy as a dichotomous outcome, 3. Social adjustment, 4. health‐related quality of life and 5. dropouts. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. \nMain results:\nWe identified 14 studies (1364 participants), 10 of which contributed to the meta‐analysis for the primary outcome. Six of these compared antidepressants and placebo, three compared two antidepressants, and one three‐armed study compared two antidepressants and placebo. In this update, we included four additional studies, three of which contributed data for the primary outcome. For acute‐phase treatment response (six to 12 weeks), antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, even though the evidence is very uncertain. This was true when depressive symptoms were measured as a continuous outcome (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.92 to −0.12; 7 studies, 511 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and when measured as a proportion of people who had depression at the end of the study (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96; 5 studies, 662 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported data on follow‐up response (more than 12 weeks). In head‐to‐head comparisons, we retrieved data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and for mirtazapine versus TCAs. There was no difference between the various classes of antidepressants (continuous outcome: SSRI versus TCA: SMD −0.08, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.18; 3 studies, 237 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; mirtazapine versus TCA: SMD −4.80, 95% CI −9.70 to 0.10; 1 study, 25 participants). There was a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants versus placebo for the secondary efficacy outcomes (continuous outcome, response at one to four weeks; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no differences for these outcomes when comparing two different classes of antidepressants, even though the evidence was very uncertain. In terms of dropouts due to any cause, we found no difference between antidepressants compared with placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; 9 studies, 889 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and between SSRIs and TCAs (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.22; 3 studies, 237 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the heterogeneous quality of the studies, imprecision arising from small sample sizes and wide CIs, and inconsistency due to statistical or clinical heterogeneity. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nDespite the impact of depression on people with cancer, the available studies were few and of low quality. This review found a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants against placebo in depressed participants with cancer. However, the certainty of evidence is very low and, on the basis of these results, it is difficult to draw clear implications for practice. The use of antidepressants in people with cancer should be considered on an individual basis and, considering the lack of head‐to‐head data, the choice of which drug to prescribe may be based on the data on antidepressant efficacy in the general population of people with major depression, also taking into account that data on people with other serious medical conditions suggest a positive safety profile for the SSRIs. Furthermore, this update shows that the usage of the newly US Food and Drug Administration‐approved antidepressant esketamine in its intravenous formulation might represent a potential treatment for this specific population of people, since it can be used both as an anaesthetic and an antidepressant. However, data are too inconclusive and further studies are needed. We conclude that to better inform clinical practice, there is an urgent need for large, simple, randomised, pragmatic trials comparing commonly used antidepressants versus placebo in people with cancer who have depressive symptoms, with or without a formal diagnosis of a depressive disorder.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the findings presented in the abstract and full-score answers, the scoring reference points for the main findings are structured as follows:\n\n- **Efficacy of Antidepressants in Cancer Patients:**\n  - Antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms compared to placebo (very low-certainty evidence).\n  - Evidence for acute-phase treatment response (six to 12 weeks) shows potential benefits but remains highly uncertain.\n  \n- **Comparison of Antidepressant Classes:**\n  - No significant differences in efficacy between SSRIs and TCAs (very low-certainty evidence).\n  - Outcomes for continuous response and proportion of depressed individuals were similar across different classes.\n  \n- **Secondary Outcomes:**\n  - Potential beneficial effects of antidepressants on secondary outcomes, such as social adjustment and health-related quality of life, but evidence is very uncertain.\n  \n- **Dropout Rates:**\n  - No significant differences in dropout rates when comparing antidepressants to placebo or across antidepressant classes (very low-certainty evidence).\n\n- **Certainty and Quality of Evidence:**\n  - Overall, studies presented are few and of low quality, resulting in downgraded evidence certainty due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and inconsistency (very low-certainty evidence).\n  \n- **Individualized Considerations for Antidepressant Use:**\n  - Choice of antidepressants for individuals should be based on personal assessments and general antidepressant efficacy data, considering potential safety profiles.\n\n- **Future Research Directions:**\n  - Need for large, simple, randomized, pragmatic trials comparing antidepressants versus placebo in cancer patients with depressive symptoms to better inform clinical practice."

    "query": "Title: Personally tailored activities for improving psychosocial outcomes for people with dementia in long‐term care\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPeople with dementia who are being cared for in long‐term care settings are often not engaged in meaningful activities. We wanted to know whether offering them activities which are tailored to their individual interests and preferences could improve their quality of life and reduce agitation. This review updates our earlier review published in 2018. \nObjectives:\n∙ To assess the effects of personally tailored activities on psychosocial outcomes for people with dementia living in long‐term care facilities. ∙ To describe the components of the interventions. ∙ To describe conditions which enhance the effectiveness of personally tailored activities in this setting. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register, on 15 June 2022. We also performed additional searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP, to ensure that the search for the review was as up‐to‐date and as comprehensive as possible. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials offering personally tailored activities. All interventions included an assessment of the participants' present or past preferences for, or interest in, particular activities as a basis for an individual activity plan. Control groups received either usual care or an active control intervention. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Our primary efficacy outcomes were agitation and participant quality of life. Where possible, we pooled data across studies using a random effects model. \nMain results:\nWe identified three new studies, and therefore included 11 studies with 1071 participants in this review update. The mean age of participants was 78 to 88 years and most had moderate or severe dementia. Ten studies were RCTs (three studies randomised clusters to the study groups, six studies randomised individual participants, and one study randomised matched pairs of participants) and one study was a non‐randomised clinical trial. Five studies included a control group receiving usual care, five studies an active control group (activities which were not personally tailored) and one study included both types of control group. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 10 days to nine months. In nine studies personally tailored activities were delivered directly to the participants. In one study nursing staff, and in another study family members, were trained to deliver the activities. The selection of activities was based on different theoretical models, but the activities delivered did not vary substantially. We judged the risk of selection bias to be high in five studies, the risk of performance bias to be high in five studies and the risk of detection bias to be high in four studies. We found low‐certainty evidence that personally tailored activities may slightly reduce agitation (standardised mean difference −0.26, 95% CI −0.53 to 0.01; I² = 50%; 7 studies, 485 participants). We also found low‐certainty evidence from one study that was not included in the meta‐analysis, indicating that personally tailored activities may make little or no difference to general restlessness, aggression, uncooperative behaviour, very negative and negative verbal behaviour (180 participants). Two studies investigated quality of life by proxy‐rating. We found low‐certainty evidence that personally tailored activities may result in little to no difference in quality of life in comparison with usual care or an active control group (MD ‐0.83, 95% CI ‐3.97 to 2.30; I² = 51%; 2 studies, 177 participants). Self‐rated quality of life was only available for a small number of participants from one study, and there was little or no difference between personally tailored activities and usual care on this outcome (MD 0.26, 95% CI −3.04 to 3.56; 42 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Two studies assessed adverse effects, but no adverse effects were observed. We are very uncertain about the effects of personally tailored activities on mood and positive affect. For negative affect we found moderate‐certainty evidence that there is probably little to no effect of personally tailored activities compared to usual care or activities which are not personalised (standardised mean difference ‐0.02, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.14; 6 studies, 632 participants). We were not able to undertake meta‐analyses for engagement and sleep‐related outcomes, and we are very uncertain whether personally tailored activities have any effect on these outcomes. Two studies that investigated the duration of the effects of personally tailored activities indicated that the intervention effects they found persisted only during the period of delivery of the activities. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOffering personally tailored activities to people with dementia in long‐term care may slightly reduce agitation. Personally tailored activities may result in little to no difference in quality of life rated by proxies, but we acknowledge concerns about the validity of proxy ratings of quality of life in severe dementia. Personally tailored activities probably have little or no effect on negative affect, and we are uncertain whether they have any effect on positive affect or mood. There was no evidence that interventions were more likely to be effective if based on one theoretical model rather than another. We included three new studies in this updated review, but two studies were pilot trials and included only a small number of participants. Certainty of evidence was predominately very low or low due to several methodological limitations of and inconsistencies between the included studies. Evidence is still limited, and we remain unable to describe optimal activity programmes. Further research should focus on methods for selecting appropriate and meaningful activities for people in different stages of dementia.",

    "query": "Title: Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nCognitive stimulation (CS) is an intervention for people with dementia offering a range of enjoyable activities providing general stimulation for thinking, concentration and memory, usually in a social setting, such as a small group. CS is distinguished from other approaches such as cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation by its broad focus and social elements, aiming to improve domains such as quality of life (QoL) and mood as well as cognitive function. Recommended in various guidelines and widely implemented internationally, questions remain regarding different modes of delivery and the clinical significance of any benefits. A systematic review of CS is important to clarify its effectiveness and place practice recommendations on a sound evidence base. This review was last updated in 2012. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of CS for people with dementia, including any negative effects, on cognition and other relevant outcomes, accounting where possible for differences in its implementation. \nSearch methods:\nWe identified trials from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, last searched on 3 March 2022. We used the search terms: cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, memory therapy, memory groups, memory support, memory stimulation, global stimulation, cognitive psychostimulation. We performed supplementary searches in a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers to ensure the search was up‐to‐date and comprehensive. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CS for dementia published in peer review journals in the English language incorporating a measure of cognitive change. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. As CS is a psychosocial intervention, we did not expect those receiving or delivering CS to be blinded to the nature of the intervention. Where necessary, we contacted study authors requesting data not provided in the papers. Where appropriate, we undertook subgroup analysis by modality (individual versus group), number of sessions and frequency, setting (community versus care home), type of control condition and dementia severity. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome. \nMain results:\nWe included 37 RCTs (with 2766 participants), 26 published since the previous update. Most evaluated CS groups; eight examined individual CS. Participants' median age was 79.7 years. Sixteen studies included participants resident in care homes or hospitals. Study quality showed indications of improvement since the previous review, with few areas of high risk of bias. Assessors were clearly blinded to treatment allocation in most studies (81%) and most studies (81%) reported use of a treatment manual by those delivering the intervention. However, in a substantial number of studies (59%), we could not find details on all aspects of the randomisation procedures, leading us to rate the risk of selection bias as unclear. We entered data in the meta‐analyses from 36 studies (2704 participants; CS: 1432, controls: 1272). The primary analysis was on changes evident immediately following the treatment period (median length 10 weeks; range 4 to 52 weeks). Only eight studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether effects were subsequently maintained (four at 6‐ to 12‐week follow‐up; four at 8‐ to 12‐month follow‐up). No negative effects were reported. Overall, we found moderate‐quality evidence for a small benefit in cognition associated with CS (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55). In the 25 studies, with 1893 participants, reporting the widely used MMSE (Mini‐Mental State Examination) test for cognitive function in dementia, there was moderate‐quality evidence of a clinically important difference of 1.99 points between CS and controls (95% CI: 1.24, 2.74). In secondary analyses, with smaller total sample sizes, again examining the difference between CS and controls on changes immediately following the intervention period, we found moderate‐quality evidence of a slight improvement in self‐reported QoL (18 studies, 1584 participants; SMD: 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.42]) as well as in QoL ratings made by proxies (staff or caregivers). We found high‐quality evidence for clinically relevant improvements in staff/interviewer ratings of communication and social interaction (5 studies, 702 participants; SMD: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.70]) and for slight benefits in instrumental Activities of Daily Living, self‐reported depressed mood, staff/interviewer‐rated anxiety and general behaviour rating scales. We found moderate‐quality evidence for slight improvements in behaviour that challenges and in basic Activities of Daily Living and low‐quality evidence for a slight improvement in staff/interviewer‐rated depressed mood. A few studies reported a range of outcomes for family caregivers. We found moderate‐quality evidence that overall CS made little or no difference to caregivers' mood or anxiety. We found a high level of inconsistency between studies in relation to both cognitive outcomes and QoL. In exploratory subgroup analyses, we did not identify an effect of modality (group versus individual) or, for group studies, of setting (community versus care home), total number of group sessions or type of control condition (treatment‐as‐usual versus active controls). However, we did find improvements in cognition were larger where group sessions were more frequent (twice weekly or more versus once weekly) and where average severity of dementia among participants at the start of the intervention was 'mild' rather than 'moderate'. Imbalance in numbers of studies and participants between subgroups and residual inconsistency requires these exploratory findings to be interpreted cautiously. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nIn this updated review, now with a much more extensive evidence base, we have again identified small, short‐term cognitive benefits for people with mild to moderate dementia participating in CS programmes. From a smaller number of studies, we have also found clinically relevant improvements in communication and social interaction and slight benefits in a range of outcomes including QoL, mood and behaviour that challenges. There are relatively few studies of individual CS, and further research is needed to delineate the effectiveness of different delivery methods (including digital and remote, individual and group) and of multi‐component programmes. We have identified that the frequency of group sessions and level of dementia severity may influence the outcomes of CS, and these aspects should be studied further. There remains an evidence gap in relation to the potential benefits of longer‐term CS programmes and their clinical significance.",

    "query": "Title: Non‐pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbances in people with dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSleep disturbances occur frequently in people with dementia with a reported prevalence of up to 40%. Common problems are increased number and duration of awakenings and increased percentage of light sleep. Sleep disturbances are associated with a number of problems for people with dementia, their relatives, and carers. In people with dementia, they may lead to worsening of cognitive symptoms, challenging behaviours such as restlessness or wandering, and further harms, such as accidental falls. Sleep disturbances are also associated with significant carer distress and have been reported as a factor contributing to institutionalisation of people with dementia. As pharmacological approaches have shown unsatisfactory results, there is a need to synthesise the research evidence on non‐pharmacological strategies to improve sleep in people with dementia. As interventions are often complex, consisting of more than one active component, and implemented in complex contexts, it may not be easy to identify effective intervention components. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of non‐pharmacological interventions on sleep disturbances in people with dementia compared to usual care, no treatment, any other non‐pharmacological intervention, or any drug treatment intended to improve sleep, and to describe the components and processes of any complex intervention included. \nSearch methods:\nWe used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 13 January 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included individually or cluster‐randomised controlled trials in people with dementia comparing non‐pharmacological interventions to improve sleep compared to usual care or to other interventions of any type. Eligible studies had to have a sleep‐related primary outcome. We included people with a diagnosis of dementia and sleep problems at baseline irrespective of age, type of dementia, severity of cognitive impairment, or setting. Studies reporting results on a mixed sample (e.g. in a nursing home) were only considered for inclusion if at least 80% of participants had dementia. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. objective sleep‐related outcomes (e.g. total nocturnal sleep time, consolidated sleep time at night, sleep efficiency, total wake time at night (or time spent awake after sleep onset), number of nocturnal awakenings, sleep onset latency, daytime/night‐time sleep ratio, night‐time/total sleep ratio over 24 hours) and 2. adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. subjective sleep‐related outcomes, 4. behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, 5. quality of life, 6. functional status, 7. institutionalisation, 8. compliance with the intervention, and 9. attrition rates. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence and chose key outcomes to be included in summary of findings tables. \nMain results:\nWe included 19 randomised controlled trials with 1335 participants allocated to treatment or control groups. Fourteen studies were conducted in nursing homes, three included community residents, one included 'inpatients', one included people from a mental health centre, and one included people from district community centres for older people. Fourteen studies were conducted in the US. We also identified nine ongoing studies. All studies applied one or more non‐pharmacological intervention aiming to improve physiological sleep in people with dementia and sleep problems. The most frequently examined single intervention was some form of light therapy (six studies), five studies included physical or social activities, three carer interventions, one daytime sleep restriction, one slow‐stroke back massage, and one transcranial electrostimulation. Seven studies examined multimodal complex interventions. Risk of bias of included studies was frequently unclear due to incomplete reporting. Therefore, we rated no study at low risk of bias. We are uncertain whether light therapy has any effect on sleep‐related outcomes (very low‐certainty evidence). Physical activities may slightly increase the total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency, and may reduce the total time awake at night and slightly reduce the number of awakenings at night (low‐certainty evidence). Social activities may slightly increase total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency (low‐certainty evidence). Carer interventions may modestly increase total nocturnal sleep time, may slightly increase sleep efficiency, and may modestly decrease the total awake time during the night (low‐certainty evidence from one study). Multimodal interventions may modestly increase total nocturnal sleep time and may modestly reduce the total wake time at night, but may result in little to no difference in number of awakenings (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effects of multimodal interventions on sleep efficiency (very low‐certainty evidence). We found low‐certainty evidence that daytime sleep restrictions, slow‐stroke back massage, and transcranial electrostimulation may result in little to no difference in sleep‐related outcomes. Only two studies reported information about adverse events, detecting only few such events in the intervention groups. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nDespite the inclusion of 19 randomised controlled trials, there is a lack of conclusive evidence concerning non‐pharmacological interventions for sleep problems in people with dementia. Although neither single nor multimodal interventions consistently improved sleep with sufficient certainty, we found some positive effects on physical and social activities as well as carer interventions. Future studies should use rigorous methods to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal interventions using current guidelines on the development and evaluation of complex interventions. At present, no single or multimodal intervention can be clearly identified as suitable for widespread implementation.",

    "query": "Title: Interventions for preventing and ameliorating cognitive deficits in adults treated with cranial irradiation\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nCognitive deficits are common in people who have received cranial irradiation and have a serious impact on daily functioning and quality of life. The benefit of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatment of cognitive deficits in this population is unclear. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 12, 2014. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing or ameliorating cognitive deficits in adults treated with cranial irradiation. \nSearch methods:\nFor this review update we searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid, and PsycInfo via Ovid to 12 September 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled (RCTs) trials that evaluated pharmacological or non‐pharmacological interventions in cranial irradiated adults, with objective cognitive functioning as a primary or secondary outcome measure. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors (MK, JD) independently extracted data from selected studies and carried out a risk of bias assessment. Cognitive function, fatigue and mood outcomes were reported. No data were pooled. \nMain results:\nEight studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this updated review. Six were from the original version of the review, and two more were added when the search was updated. Nineteen further studies were assessed as part of this update but did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Of the eight included studies, four studies investigated “prevention” of cognitive problems (during radiotherapy and follow‐up) and four studies investigated “amelioration” (interventions to treat cognitive impairment as a late complication of radiotherapy). There were five pharmacological studies (two studies on prevention and three in amelioration) and three non‐pharmacological studies (two on prevention and one in amelioration). Due to differences between studies in the interventions being evaluated, a meta‐analysis was not possible.  Studies in early radiotherapy treatment phase (five studies) Pharmacological studies in the “early radiotherapy treatment phase” were designed to prevent or ameliorate cognitive deficits and included drugs used in dementia (memantine) and fatigue (d‐threo‐methylphenidate hydrochloride). Non‐pharmacological studies in the “early radiotherapy treatment phase” included a ketogenic diet and a two‐week cognitive rehabilitation and problem‐solving programme.  In the memantine study, the primary cognitive outcome of memory at six months did not reach significance, but there was significant improvement in overall cognitive function compared to placebo, with similar adverse events across groups. The d‐threo‐methylphenidate hydrochloride study found no statistically significant difference between arms, with few adverse events. The study of a calorie‐restricted ketogenic diet found no effect, although a lower than expected calorie intake in the control group complicates interpretation of the results.  The study investigating the utility of a rehabilitation program did not carry out a statistical comparison of cognitive performance between groups.  Studies in delayed radiation or late effect phase (four studies) The “amelioration” pharmacological studies to treat cognitive complications of radiotherapy included drugs used in dementia (donepezil) or psychostimulants (methylphenidate and modafinil). Non‐pharmacological measures included cognitive rehabilitation and problem solving (Goal Management Training). These studies included patients with cognitive problems at entry who had “stable” brain cancer.  The donepezil study did not find an improvement in the primary cognitive outcome of overall cognitive performance, but did find improvement in an individual test of memory, compared to placebo; adverse events were not reported. A study comparing methylphenidate with modafinil found improvements in cognitive function in both the methylphenidate and modafinil arms; few adverse events were reported. Another  study comparing two different doses of modafinil combined treatment arms and found improvements across all cognitive tests, however, a number of adverse events were reported. Both studies were limited by a small sample size. The Goal Management Training study suggested a benefit of the intervention, a behavioural intervention that combined mindfulness and strategy training, on executive function and processing speed.  There were a number of limitations across studies and few were without high risks of bias. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nIn this update, limited additional evidence was found for the treatment or amelioration of cognitive deficits in adults treated with cranial irradiation. As concluded in the original review, there is supportive evidence that memantine may help prevent cognitive deficits for adults with brain metastases receiving cranial irradiation. There is supportive evidence that donepezil, methylphenidate and modafinil may have a role in treating cognitive deficits in adults with brain tumours who have been treated with cranial irradiation; patient withdrawal affected the statistical power of these studies. Further research that tries to minimise the withdrawal of consent, and subsequently reduce the requirement for imputation procedures, may offer a higher certainty of evidence. There is evidence from only a single small study to support non‐pharmacological interventions in the amelioration of cognitive deficits. Further research is required.",

    "query": "Title: Pharmacological interventions for prevention of weight gain in people with schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAntipsychotic‐induced weight gain is an extremely common problem in people with schizophrenia and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Adjunctive pharmacological interventions may be necessary to help manage antipsychotic‐induced weight gain. This review splits and updates a previous Cochrane Review that focused on both pharmacological and behavioural approaches to this problem. \nObjectives:\nTo determine the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for preventing antipsychotic‐induced weight gain in people with schizophrenia. \nSearch methods:\nThe Cochrane Schizophrenia Information Specialist searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's Register of Trials on 10 February 2021. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined any adjunctive pharmacological intervention for preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses who use antipsychotic medications. \nData collection and analysis:\nAt least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. For continuous outcomes, we combined mean differences (MD) in endpoint and change data in the analysis. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to judge certainty of evidence and create summary of findings tables. The primary outcomes for this review were clinically important change in weight, clinically important change in body mass index (BMI), leaving the study early, compliance with treatment, and frequency of nausea. The included studies rarely reported these outcomes, so, post hoc, we added two new outcomes, average endpoint/change in weight and average endpoint/change in BMI. \nMain results:\nSeventeen RCTs, with a total of 1388 participants, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Five studies investigated metformin, three topiramate, three H2 antagonists, three monoamine modulators, and one each investigated monoamine modulators plus betahistine, melatonin and samidorphan. The comparator in all studies was placebo or no treatment (i.e. standard care alone). We synthesised all studies in a quantitative meta‐analysis. Most studies inadequately reported their methods of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel. The resulting risk of bias and often small sample sizes limited the overall certainty of the evidence. Only one reboxetine study reported the primary outcome, number of participants with clinically important change in weight. Fewer people in the treatment condition experienced weight gains of more than 5% and more than 7% of their bodyweight than those in the placebo group (> 5% weight gain RR 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.65; 1 study, 43 participants; > 7% weight gain RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.83; 1 study, 43 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported the primary outcomes, 'clinically important change in BMI', or 'compliance with treatment'. However, several studies reported 'average endpoint/change in body weight' or 'average endpoint/change in BMI'. Metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain (MD −4.03 kg, 95% CI −5.78 to −2.28; 4 studies, 131 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and BMI increase (MD −1.63 kg/m2, 95% CI −2.96 to −0.29; 5 studies, 227 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Other agents that may be slightly effective in preventing weight gain include H2 antagonists such as nizatidine, famotidine and ranitidine (MD −1.32 kg, 95% CI −2.09 to −0.56; 3 studies, 248 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and monoamine modulators such as reboxetine and fluoxetine (weight: MD −1.89 kg, 95% CI −3.31 to −0.47; 3 studies, 103 participants; low‐certainty evidence; BMI: MD −0.66 kg/m2, 95% CI −1.05 to −0.26; 3 studies, 103 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Topiramate did not appear effective in preventing weight gain (MD −4.82 kg, 95% CI −9.99 to 0.35; 3 studies, 168 participants; very low‐certainty evidence ) . For all agents, there was no difference between groups in terms of individuals leaving the study or reports of nausea. However, the results of these outcomes are uncertain given the very low‐certainty evidence. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain. Interpretation of this result and those for other agents, is limited by the small number of studies, small sample size, and short study duration. In future, we need studies that are adequately powered and with longer treatment durations to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for managing weight gain.",

    "query": "Title: Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of disordered and problem gambling\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPharmacological interventions for disordered and problem gambling have been employed in clinical practice. Despite the availability of several reviews of the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for disordered or problem gambling, few have employed systematic search strategies or compared different categories of pharmacological interventions. Systematic reviews of high‐quality evidence are therefore essential to provide guidance regarding the efficacy of different pharmacological interventions for disordered or problem gambling. \nObjectives:\nThe primary aims of the review were to: (1) examine the efficacy of major categories of pharmacological‐only interventions (antidepressants, opioid antagonists, mood stabilisers, atypical antipsychotics) for disordered or problem gambling, relative to placebo control conditions; and (2) examine the efficacy of these major categories relative to each other.  \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (all years to 11 January 2022). \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised trials evaluating a pharmacological intervention for the treatment of disordered or problem gambling. Eligible control conditions included placebo control groups or comparisons with another category of pharmacological intervention. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures, including systematic extraction of included study characteristics and results and risk of bias assessment. Our primary outcome was reduction in gambling symptom severity. Our secondary outcomes were reduction in gambling expenditure, gambling frequency, time spent gambling, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment; and responder status. We evaluated treatment effects for continuous and dichotomous outcomes using standardised mean difference (SMD) and risk ratios (RR), respectively, employing random‐effects meta‐analyses. A minimum of two independent treatment effects were required for a meta‐analysis to be conducted (with only meta‐analytic findings reported in this abstract). \nMain results:\nWe included 17 studies in the review (n = 1193 randomised) that reported outcome data scheduled for end of treatment. Length of treatment ranged from 7 to 96 weeks.  Antidepressants:  Six studies (n = 268) evaluated antidepressants, with very low to low certainty evidence suggesting that antidepressants were no more effective than placebo at post‐treatment: gambling symptom severity (SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.74 to 0.09, n = 225), gambling expenditure (SMD −0.27, 95% CI −0.60 to 0.06, n = 144), depressive symptoms (SMD −0.19, 95% CI −0.60 to 0.23, n = 90), functional impairment (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.53 to 0.22, n = 110), and responder status (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.66, n = 268). Opioid antagonists:  Four studies (n = 562) evaluated opioid antagonists, with very low to low certainty evidence showing a medium beneficial effect of treatment on gambling symptom severity relative to placebo at post‐treatment (SMD −0.46, 95% CI −0.74 to −0.19, n = 259), but no difference between groups in responder status (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.14, n = 562). Mood stabilisers:  Two studies (n = 71) evaluated mood stabilisers (including anticonvulsants), with very low certainty evidence suggesting that mood stabilisers were no more effective than placebo at post‐treatment: gambling symptom severity (SMD −0.92, 95% CI −2.24 to 0.39, n = 71), depressive symptoms (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −1.14 to 0.83, n = 71), and anxiety symptoms (SMD −0.17, 95% CI −0.64 to 0.30, n = 71). Atypical antipsychotics: Two studies (n = 63) evaluated the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, with very low certainty evidence showing a medium beneficial effect of treatment on gambling symptom severity relative to placebo at post‐treatment (SMD −0.59, 95% CI −1.10 to −0.08, n = 63). Comparative effectiveness:  Two studies (n = 62) compared antidepressants with opioid antagonists, with very low certainty evidence indicating that antidepressants were no more effective than opioid antagonists on depressive symptoms (SMD 0.22, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.72, n = 62) or anxiety symptoms (SMD 0.21, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.72, n = 62) at post‐treatment. Two studies (n = 58) compared antidepressants with mood stabilisers (including anticonvulsants), with very low certainty evidence indicating that antidepressants were no more effective than mood stabilisers on depressive symptoms (SMD 0.02, 95% CI −0.53 to 0.56, n = 58) or anxiety symptoms (SMD 0.16, 95% CI −0.39 to 0.70, n = 58) at post‐treatment. Tolerability and adverse events:  Several common adverse effects were reported by participants receiving antidepressants (e.g. headaches, nausea, diarrhoea/gastrointestinal issues) and opioid antagonists (e.g. nausea, dry mouth, constipation). There was little consistency in the types of adverse effects experienced by participants receiving mood stabilisers (e.g. tiredness, headaches, concentration difficulties) or atypical antipsychotics (e.g. pneumonia, sedation, increased hypomania). Discontinuation of treatment due to these adverse events was highest for opioid antagonists (10% to 32%), followed by antidepressants (4% to 31%), atypical antipsychotics (14%), and mood stabilisers (13%). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review provides preliminary support for the use of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine) to produce short‐term improvements in gambling symptom severity, although a lack of available evidence precludes a conclusion regarding the degree to which these pharmacological agents can improve other gambling or psychological functioning indices. In contrast, the findings are inconclusive with regard to the effects of mood stabilisers (including anticonvulsants) in the treatment of disordered or problem gambling, and there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of antidepressants. However, these conclusions are based on very low to low certainty evidence characterised by a small number of included studies, high risk of bias, modest pooled sample sizes, imprecise estimates, moderate between‐study heterogeneity, and exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidities. Moreover, there were insufficient studies to conduct meta‐analyses on many outcome measures; to compare efficacy across and within major categories of interventions; to explore dosage effects; or to examine effects beyond post‐treatment. These limitations suggest that, despite recommendations related to the administration of opioid antagonists in the treatment of disordered or problem gambling, pharmacological interventions should be administered with caution and with careful consideration of patient needs. A larger and more methodologically rigorous evidence base with longer‐term evaluation periods is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness and durability of pharmacological treatments for disordered or problem gambling.",

    "query": "Title: Interventions for preventing and reducing the use of physical restraints of older people in general hospital settings\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPhysical restraints, such as bedrails, belts in chairs or beds, and fixed tables, are commonly used for older people in general hospital settings. Reasons given for using physical restraints are to prevent falls and fall‐related injuries, to control challenging behavior (such as agitation or wandering), and to ensure the delivery of medical treatments. Clear evidence of their effectiveness is lacking, and potential harms are recognised, including injuries associated with the use of physical restraints and a negative impact on people's well‐being. There are widespread recommendations that their use should be reduced or eliminated. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the best evidence for the effects and safety of interventions aimed at preventing and reducing the use of physical restraint of older people in general hospital settings. To describe the content, components and processes of these interventions. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 20 April 2022. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that investigated the effects of interventions that aimed to prevent or reduce the use of physical restraints in general hospital settings. Eligible settings were acute care and rehabilitation wards. We excluded emergency departments, intensive care and psychiatric units, as well as the use of restrictive measures for penal reasons (e.g. prisoners in general medical wards). We included studies with a mean age of study participants of at least 65 years. Control groups received usual care or active control interventions that were ineligible for inclusion as experimental interventions. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently selected the articles for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. Data were unsuitable for meta‐analysis, and we reported results narratively. We used GRADE methods to describe our certainty in the results. \nMain results:\nWe included four studies: two randomised controlled trials (one individually‐randomised, parallel‐group trial and one clustered, stepped‐wedge trial) and two controlled clinical trials (both with a clustered design). One study was conducted in general medical wards in Canada and three studies were conducted in rehabilitation hospitals in Hong Kong. A total of 1709 participants were included in three studies; in the fourth study the number of participants was not reported. The mean age ranged from 67 years to 84 years. The duration of follow‐up covered the period of patients' hospitalisation in one study (21 days average length of stay) and ranged from 4 to 11 months in the other studies. The definition of physical restraints differed slightly, and one study did not include bedrails. Three studies investigated organisational interventions aimed at implementing a least‐restraint policy to reduce physical restraints. The theoretical approach of the interventions and the content of the educational components was comparable across studies. The fourth study investigated the use of pressure sensors for participants with an increased falls risk, which gave an alarm if the participant left the bed or chair. Control groups in all studies received usual care. Three studies were at high risk of selection bias and risk of detection bias was unclear in all studies. Because of very low‐certainty evidence, we are uncertain about the effect of organisational interventions aimed at implementing a least‐restraint policy on our primary efficacy outcome: the use of physical restraints in general hospital settings. One study found an increase in the number of participants with at least one physical restraint in the intervention and control groups, one study found a small reduction in both groups, and in the third study (the stepped‐wedge study), the number of participants with at least one physical restraint decreased in all clusters after implementation of the intervention but no detailed information was reported. For the use of bed or chair pressure sensor alarms for people with an increased fall risk, we found moderate‐certainty evidence of little to no effect of the intervention on the number of participants with at least one physical restraint compared with usual care. None of the studies systematically assessed adverse events related to use of physical restraint use, e.g. direct injuries, or reported such events. We are uncertain about the effect of organisational interventions aimed at implementing a least‐restraint policy on the number of participants with at least one fall (very low‐certainty evidence), and there was no evidence that organisational interventions or the use of bed or chair pressure sensor alarms for people with an increased fall risk reduce the number of falls (low‐certainty evidence from one study each). None of the studies reported fall‐related injuries. We found low‐certainty evidence that organisational interventions may result in little to no difference in functioning (including mobility), and moderate‐certainty evidence that the use of bed or chair pressure sensor alarms has little to no effect on mobility. We are uncertain about the effect of organisational interventions on the use of psychotropic medication; one study found no difference in the prescription of psychotropic medication. We are uncertain about the effect of organisational interventions on nurses' attitudes and knowledge about the use of physical restraints (very low‐certainty evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe are uncertain whether organisational interventions aimed at implementing a least‐restraint policy can reduce physical restraints in general hospital settings. The use of pressure sensor alarms in beds or chairs for people with an increased fall risk has probably little to no effect on the use of physical restraints. Because of the small number of studies and the study limitations, the results should be interpreted with caution. Further research on effective strategies to implement a least‐restraint policy and to overcome barriers to physical restraint reduction in general hospital settings is needed.",

    "query": "Title: Antithrombotic therapy to prevent cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease on neuroimaging but without dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nCerebral small vessel disease is a progressive disease of the brain's deep perforating blood vessels. It is usually diagnosed based on lesions seen on brain imaging. Cerebral small vessel disease is a common cause of stroke but can also cause a progressive cognitive decline. As antithrombotic therapy is an established treatment for stroke prevention, we sought to determine whether antithrombotic therapy might also be effective in preventing cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of antithrombotic therapy for prevention of cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease on neuroimaging but without dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Review Group's Specialised Register, and the Cochrane Stroke Group's Specialised Register; the most recent search was on 21 July 2021. We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registries. We searched the reference lists of the articles retrieved from these searches. As trials with a stroke focus may include relevant subgroup data, we complemented these searches with a focussed search of all antithrombotic titles in the Cochrane Stroke Group database.  \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCT) of people with neuroimaging evidence of at least mild cerebral small vessel disease (defined here as white matter hyperintensities, lacunes of presumed vascular origin and subcortical infarcts) but with no evidence of dementia. The trials had to compare antithrombotic therapy of minimum 24 weeks' duration to no antithrombotic therapy (either placebo or treatment as usual), or compare different antithrombotic treatment regimens. Antithrombotic therapy could include antiplatelet agents (as monotherapy or combination therapy), anticoagulants or a combination. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently screened all the titles identified by the searches. We assessed full texts for eligibility for inclusion according to our prespecified selection criteria, extracted data to a proforma and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Due to heterogeneity across included participants, interventions and outcomes of eligible trials, it was not possible to perform meta‐analyses. \nMain results:\nWe included three RCTs (3384 participants). One study investigated the effect of antithrombotic therapy in participants not yet on antithrombotic therapy; two studies investigated the effect of additional antithrombotic therapy, one in a population already taking a single antithrombotic agent and one in a mixed population (participants on an antithrombotic drug and antithrombotic‐naive participants). Intervention and follow‐up durations varied from 24 weeks to four years. Jia 2016 was a placebo‐controlled trial assessing 24 weeks of treatment with DL‐3‐n‐butylphthalide (a compound with multimodal actions, including a putative antiplatelet effect) in 280 Chinese participants with vascular cognitive impairment caused by subcortical ischaemic small vessel disease, but without dementia. There was very low‐certainty evidence for a small difference in cognitive test scores favouring treatment with DL‐3‐n‐butylphthalide, as measured by the 12‐item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive subscale (adjusted mean difference −1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.02 to −0.12), but this difference may not be clinically relevant. There was also very low‐certainty evidence for greater proportional improvement measured with the Clinician Interview‐Based Impression of Change‐Plus Caregiver Input (57% with DL‐3‐n‐butylphthalide versus 42% with placebo; P = 0.01), but there was no difference in other measures of cognition (Mini‐Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating) or function. There was no evidence of a difference in adverse events between treatment groups. The SILENCE RCT compared antithrombotic therapy (aspirin) and placebo during four years of treatment in 83 participants with 'silent brain infarcts' who were on no prior antithrombotic therapy. There was very low‐certainty evidence for no difference between groups across various measures of cognition and function, rates of stroke or adverse events. The Secondary Prevention of Subcortical Stroke Study (SPS3) compared dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) to aspirin alone in 3020 participants with recent lacunar stroke. There was low‐certainty evidence of no effect on cognitive outcomes as measured by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instruments (CASI) assessed annually over five years. There was also low‐certainty evidence of no difference in the annual incidence of mild cognitive decline between the two treatment groups (9.7% with dual antiplatelet therapy versus 9.9% with aspirin), or the annual stroke recurrence rate (2.5% with dual antiplatelet therapy versus 2.7% with aspirin). Bleeding risk may be higher with dual antiplatelet therapy (hazard ratio (HR) 2.15, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.11; low certainty evidence), but there may be no significant increase in intracerebral bleeding risk (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.93; low‐certainty evidence). None of the included trials assessed the incidence of new dementia. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found no convincing evidence to suggest any clinically relevant cognitive benefit of using antithrombotic therapy in addition to standard treatment in people with cerebral small vessel disease but without dementia, but there may be an increased bleeding risk with this approach. There was marked heterogeneity across the trials and the certainty of the evidence was generally poor.",

    "query": "Title: Antipsychotics for schizophrenia spectrum disorders with catatonic symptoms\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nWhilst antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, there have been numerous attempts to identify biomarkers that can predict treatment response. One potential marker may be psychomotor abnormalities, including catatonic symptoms. Early studies suggested that catatonic symptoms predict poor treatment response, whilst anecdotal reports of rare adverse events have been invoked against antipsychotics. The efficacy and safety of antipsychotics in the treatment of this subtype of schizophrenia have rarely been studied in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). \nObjectives:\nTo compare the effects of any single antipsychotic medication with another antipsychotic or with other pharmacological agents, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), other non‐pharmacological neuromodulation therapies (e.g. transcranial magnetic stimulation), or placebo for treating positive, negative, and catatonic symptoms in people who have schizophrenia spectrum disorders with catatonic symptoms. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and WHO ICTRP, on 19 September 2021. There were no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We also manually searched reference lists from the included studies, and contacted study authors when relevant. \nSelection criteria:\nAll RCTs comparing any single antipsychotic medication with another antipsychotic or with other pharmacological agents, ECT, other non‐pharmacological neuromodulation therapies, or placebo for people who have schizophrenia spectrum disorders with catatonic symptoms.  \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we planned to calculate risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous outcomes, we planned to calculate mean differences between groups and their 95% CI. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies, and created a summary of findings table; however, we did not assess the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach because there was no quantitative evidence in the included study.  \nMain results:\nOut of 53 identified reports, one RCT including 14 hospitalised adults with schizophrenia and catatonic symptoms met the inclusion criteria of the review. The study, which was conducted in India and lasted only three weeks, compared risperidone with ECT in people who did not respond to an initial lorazepam trial.   There were no usable data reported on the primary efficacy outcomes of clinically important changes in positive, negative, or catatonic symptoms. Whilst both study groups improved in catatonia scores on the Bush‐Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), the ECT group showed significantly greater improvement at week 3 endpoint (mean +/− estimated standard deviation; 0.68 +/− 4.58; N = 8) than the risperidone group (6.04 +/− 4.58; N = 6; P = 0.035 of a two‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures originally conducted in the trial). Similarly, both groups improved on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores by week 3, but ECT showed significantly greater improvement in positive symptoms scores compared with risperidone (P = 0.04). However, data on BFCRS scores in the ECT group appeared to be skewed, and mean PANSS scores were not reported, thereby precluding further analyses of both BFCRS and PANSS data according to the protocol.  Although no cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome were reported, extrapyramidal symptoms as a primary safety outcome were reported in three cases in the risperidone group. Conversely, headache (N = 6), memory loss (N = 4), and a prolonged seizure were reported in people receiving ECT. These adverse effects, which were assessed as specific for antipsychotics and ECT, respectively, were the only adverse effects reported in the study. However, the exact number of participants with adverse events was not clearly reported in both groups, precluding further analysis.   Our results were based only on a single study with a very small sample size, short duration of treatment, unclear or high risk of bias due to unclear randomisation methods, possible imbalance in baseline characteristics, skewed data, and selective reporting. Data on outcomes of general functioning, global state, quality of life, and service use, as well as data on specific phenomenology and duration of catatonic symptoms, were not reported.   \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found only one small, short‐term trial suggesting that risperidone may improve catatonic and positive symptoms scale scores amongst people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and catatonic symptoms, but that ECT may result in greater improvement in the first three weeks of treatment. Due to small sample size, methodological shortcomings and brief duration of the study, as well as risk of bias, the evidence from this review is of very low quality. We are uncertain if these are true effects, limiting any conclusions that can be drawn from the evidence. No cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome were reported, but we cannot rule out the risk of this or other rare adverse events in larger population samples.  High‐quality trials continue to be necessary to differentiate treatments for people with symptoms of catatonia in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The lack of consensus on the psychopathology of catatonia remains a barrier to defining treatments for people with schizophrenia. Better understanding of the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics may clarify treatment for this unique subtype of schizophrenia.",

    "query": "Title: Cognitive behavioural therapy (group) for schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSchizophrenia is a disabling psychotic disorder characterised by positive symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech and behaviour; and negative symptoms such as affective flattening and lack of motivation. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention that aims to change the way in which a person interprets and evaluates their experiences, helping them to identify and link feelings and patterns of thinking that underpin distress. CBT models targeting symptoms of psychosis (CBTp) have been developed for many mental health conditions including schizophrenia. CBTp has been suggested as a useful add‐on therapy to medication for people with schizophrenia. While CBT for people with schizophrenia was mainly developed as an individual treatment, it is expensive and a group approach may be more cost‐effective. Group CBTp can be defined as a group intervention targeting psychotic symptoms, based on the cognitive behavioural model. In group CBTp, people work collaboratively on coping with distressing hallucinations, analysing evidence for their delusions, and developing problem‐solving and social skills. However, the evidence for effectiveness is far from conclusive. \nObjectives:\nTo investigate efficacy and acceptability of group CBT applied to psychosis compared with standard care or other psychosocial interventions, for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. \nSearch methods:\nOn 10 February 2021, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials, which is based on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registries. We handsearched the reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews and contacted experts in the field for supplemental data. \nSelection criteria:\nWe selected randomised controlled trials allocating adults with schizophrenia to receive either group CBT for schizophrenia, compared with standard care, or any other psychosocial intervention (group or individual). \nData collection and analysis:\nWe complied with Cochrane recommended standard of conduct for data screening and collection. Where possible, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary data and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous data. We used a random‐effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a summary of findings table using GRADE. \nMain results:\nThe review includes 24 studies (1900 participants). All studies compared group CBTp with treatments that a person with schizophrenia would normally receive in a standard mental health service (standard care) or any other psychosocial intervention (group or individual). None of the studies compared group CBTp with individual CBTp. Overall risk of bias within the trials was moderate to low. We found no studies reporting data for our primary outcome of clinically important change. With regard to numbers of participants leaving the study early, group CBTp has little or no effect compared to standard care or other psychosocial interventions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.59; studies = 13, participants = 1267; I 2  = 9%; low‐certainty evidence). Group CBTp may have some advantage over standard care or other psychosocial interventions for overall mental state at the end of treatment for endpoint scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total (MD –3.73, 95% CI –4.63 to –2.83; studies = 12, participants = 1036; I 2  = 5%; low‐certainty evidence). Group CBTp seems to have little or no effect on PANSS positive symptoms (MD –0.45, 95% CI –1.30 to 0.40; studies =8, participants = 539; I 2  = 0%) and on PANSS negative symptoms scores at the end of treatment (MD –0.73, 95% CI –1.68 to 0.21; studies = 9, participants = 768; I 2  = 65%). Group CBTp seems to have an advantage over standard care or other psychosocial interventions on global functioning measured by Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF; MD –3.61, 95% CI –6.37 to –0.84; studies = 5, participants = 254; I 2  = 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence), Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP; MD 3.30, 95% CI 2.00 to 4.60; studies = 1, participants = 100), and Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS; MD –1.27, 95% CI –2.46 to –0.08; studies = 1, participants = 116). Service use data were equivocal with no real differences between treatment groups for number of participants hospitalised (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.60; studies = 3, participants = 235; I 2  = 34%). There was no clear difference between group CBTp and standard care or other psychosocial interventions endpoint scores on depression and quality of life outcomes, except for quality of life measured by World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment Instrument (WHOQOL‐BREF) Psychological domain subscale (MD –4.64, 95% CI –9.04 to –0.24; studies = 2, participants = 132; I 2  = 77%). The studies did not report relapse or adverse effects. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nGroup CBTp appears to be no better or worse than standard care or other psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia in terms of leaving the study early, service use and general quality of life. Group CBTp seems to be more effective than standard care or other psychosocial interventions on overall mental state and global functioning scores. These results may not be widely applicable as each study had a low sample size. Therefore, no firm conclusions concerning the efficacy of group CBTp for people with schizophrenia can currently be made. More high‐quality research, reporting useable and relevant data is needed.",

    "query": "Title: Community‐based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high‐income countries\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAn unprecedented number of people around the world are experiencing forced displacement due to natural or man‐made events. More than 50% of refugees worldwide are children or adolescents. In addition to the challenges of settling in a new country, many have witnessed or experienced traumatic events. Therefore, refugee children and adolescents are at risk of developing mental health problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, and require appropriate and effective support within communities. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness and acceptability of community‐based interventions (RCTs only) in comparison with controls (no treatment, waiting list, alternative treatment) for preventing and treating mental health problems (major depression, anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress) and improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high‐income countries. \nSearch methods:\nDatabases searches included the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (all available years), CENTRAL/CDSR (2021, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trials registries to 21 February 2021. We checked reference lists of included study reports.  \nSelection criteria:\nStudies of any design were eligible as long as they included child or adolescent refugees and evaluated a community‐based mental health intervention in a high‐income country. At a second stage, we selected randomised controlled trials. \nData collection and analysis:\nFor randomised controlled trials, we extracted data relating to the study and participant characteristics, and outcome data relating to the results of the trial. For studies using other evaluation methods, we extracted data relating to the study and participant characteristics. W derived evidence on the efficacy and availability of interventions from the randomised controlled trials only. Data were synthesised narratively. \nMain results:\nWe screened 5005 records and sought full‐text manuscripts of 62 relevant records. Three randomised controlled trials were included in this review. Key concerns in the risk of bias assessments included a lack of clarity about the randomisation process, potential for bias is outcome measurement, and risk of bias in the selection of results. Primary outcomes There was no evidence of an effect of community‐based interventions when compared with a waiting list for symptoms of post‐traumatic stress (mean difference (MD) −1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) −6.78 to 3.86: 1 study; low‐certainty evidence), symptoms of depression (MD 0.26, 95% CI −2.15 to 2.67: 1 study; low‐certainty evidence), and psychological distress (MD −10.5, 95% CI −47.94 to 26.94; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence).  There were no data on adverse events. Secondary outcomes Three trials reported on short‐term changes in child behaviour, using different measures, and found no evidence of an effect of the intervention versus a waiting list (low to very low certainty). None of the trials reported on quality of life or well‐being, participation and functioning, or participant satisfaction. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy and acceptability of community‐based mental health interventions for refugee children and adolescents.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Effectiveness on Mental Health Symptoms**: The review found no significant evidence of community-based interventions' effectiveness compared to a waiting list in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, or psychological distress.

    "query": "Title: Psychological treatments for depression and anxiety in dementia and mild cognitive impairment\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nExperiencing anxiety and depression is very common in people living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). There is uncertainty about the best treatment approach. Drug treatments may be ineffective and associated with adverse effects. Guidelines recommend psychological treatments. In this updated systematic review, we investigated the effectiveness of different psychological treatment approaches. \nObjectives:\nPrimary objective To assess the clinical effectiveness of psychological interventions in reducing depression and anxiety in people with dementia or MCI. Secondary objectives To determine whether psychological interventions improve individuals' quality of life, cognition, activities of daily living (ADL), and reduce behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and whether they improve caregiver quality of life or reduce caregiver burden. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and three trials registers on 18 February 2021. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a psychological intervention for depression or anxiety with treatment as usual (TAU) or another control intervention in people with dementia or MCI. \nData collection and analysis:\nA minimum of two authors worked independently to select trials, extract data, and assess studies for risk of bias. We classified the included psychological interventions as cognitive behavioural therapies (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), behavioural activation (BA), problem‐solving therapy (PST)); 'third‐wave' therapies (such as mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT)); supportive and counselling therapies; and interpersonal therapies. We compared each class of intervention with control. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences or risk ratios. Where possible, we pooled data using a fixed‐effects model. We used GRADE methods to assess the certainty of the evidence behind each result. \nMain results:\nWe included 29 studies with 2599 participants. They were all published between 1997 and 2020. There were 15 trials of cognitive behavioural therapies (4 CBT, 8 BA, 3 PST), 11 trials of supportive and counselling therapies, three trials of MBCT, and one of interpersonal therapy. The comparison groups received either usual care, attention‐control education, or enhanced usual care incorporating an active control condition that was not a specific psychological treatment. There were 24 trials of people with a diagnosis of dementia, and five trials of people with MCI. Most studies were conducted in community settings. We considered none of the studies to be at low risk of bias in all domains.  Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT, BA, PST) Cognitive behavioural therapies are probably slightly better than treatment as usual or active control conditions for reducing depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.23, 95% CI ‐0.37 to ‐0.10; 13 trials, 893 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). They may also increase rates of depression remission at the end of treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.88; 2 studies, with one study contributing 2 independent comparisons, 146 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We were very uncertain about the effect of cognitive behavioural therapies on anxiety at the end of treatment (SMD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.30; 3 trials, 143 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapies probably improve patient quality of life (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.50; 7 trials, 459 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and activities of daily living at end of treatment compared to treatment as usual or active control (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.40 to ‐0.09; 7 trials, 680 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Supportive and counselling interventions Meta‐analysis showed that supportive and counselling interventions may have little or no effect on depressive symptoms in people with dementia compared to usual care at end of treatment (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.07; 9 trials, 994 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We were very uncertain about the effects of these treatments on anxiety, which was assessed only in one small pilot study. Other interventions There were very few data and very low‐certainty evidence on MBCT and interpersonal therapy, so we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of these interventions. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nCBT‐based treatments added to usual care probably slightly reduce symptoms of depression for people with dementia and MCI and may increase rates of remission of depression. There may be important effect modifiers (degree of baseline depression, cognitive diagnosis, or content of the intervention). CBT‐based treatments probably also have a small positive effect on quality of life and activities of daily living. Supportive and counselling interventions may not improve symptoms of depression in people with dementia. Effects of both types of treatment on anxiety symptoms are very uncertain. We are also uncertain about the effects of other types of psychological treatments, and about persistence of effects over time. To inform clinical guidelines, future studies should assess detailed components of these interventions and their implementation in different patient populations and in different settings.",

    "query": "Title: Algorithm‐based pain management for people with dementia in nursing homes\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPeople with dementia in nursing homes often experience pain, but often do not receive adequate pain therapy. The experience of pain has a significant impact on quality of life in people with dementia, and is associated with negative health outcomes. Untreated pain is also considered to be one of the causes of challenging behaviour, such as agitation or aggression, in this population. One approach to reducing pain in people with dementia in nursing homes is an algorithm‐based pain management strategy, i.e. the use of a structured protocol that involves pain assessment and a series of predefined treatment steps consisting of various non‐pharmacological and pharmacological pain management interventions. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions to reduce pain and challenging behaviour in people with dementia living in nursing homes. To describe the components of the interventions and the content of the algorithms. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 30 June 2021. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of algorithm‐based pain management interventions for people with dementia living in nursing homes. All interventions had to include an initial pain assessment, a treatment algorithm (a treatment plan consisting of at least two different non‐pharmacological or pharmacological treatment steps to reduce pain), and criteria to assess the success of each treatment step. The control groups could receive usual care or an active control intervention. Primary outcomes for this review were pain‐related outcomes, e.g. the number of participants with pain (self‐ or proxy‐rated), challenging behaviour (we used a broad definition that could also include agitation or behavioural and psychological symptoms assessed with any validated instrument), and serious adverse events. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo authors independently selected the articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of all included studies. We reported results narratively as there were too few studies for a meta‐analysis. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the results. \nMain results:\nWe included three cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a total of 808 participants (mean age 82 to 89 years). In two studies, participants had severe cognitive impairment and in one study mild to moderate impairment. The algorithms used in the studies varied in the number of treatment steps. The comparator was pain education for nursing staff in two studies and usual care in one study. We judged the risk of detection bias to be high in one study. The risk of selection bias and performance bias was unclear in all studies. Self‐rated pain (i.e. pain rated by participants themselves) was reported in two studies. In one study, all residents in the nursing homes were included, but fewer than half of the participants experienced pain at baseline, and the mean values of self‐rated and proxy‐rated pain at baseline and follow‐up in both study groups were below the threshold of pain that may require treatment. We considered the evidence from this study to be very low‐certainty and therefore are uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.05, 170 participants; Verbal Descriptor Scale, range 0 to 3). In the other study, all participants had mild to moderate pain at baseline. Here, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may have little to no effect on self‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education (MD 0.4, 95% CI ‐0.58 to 1.38, 246 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). Pain was rated by proxy in all three studies. Again, we considered the evidence from the study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline to be very low‐certainty and were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had an effect on proxy‐rated pain intensity compared with pain education. For participants with mild to moderate pain at baseline, we found low‐certainty evidence that an algorithm‐based pain management intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain intensity in comparison with usual care (MD ‐1.49, 95% CI ‐2.11 to ‐0.87, 1 study, 128 participants; Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale‐Chinese version, range 0 to 10), but may not be more effective than pain education (MD ‐0.2, 95% CI ‐0.79 to 0.39, 1 study, 383 participants; Iowa Pain Thermometer, range 0 to 12). For challenging behaviour, we found very low‐certainty evidence from one study in which mean pain scores indicated no pain, or almost no pain, at baseline. We were uncertain whether the algorithm‐based pain management intervention had any more effect than education for nursing staff on challenging behaviour of participants (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐1.88 to 1.46, 1 study, 170 participants; Cohen‐Mansfield Agitation Inventory‐Chinese version, range 7 to 203). None of the studies systematically assessed adverse effects or serious adverse effects and no study reported information about the occurrence of any adverse effect. None of the studies assessed any of the other outcomes of this review. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is no clear evidence for a benefit of an algorithm‐based pain management intervention in comparison with pain education for reducing pain intensity or challenging behaviour in people with dementia in nursing homes. We found that the intervention may reduce proxy‐rated pain compared with usual care. However, the certainty of evidence is low because of the small number of studies, small sample sizes, methodological limitations, and the clinical heterogeneity of the study populations (e.g. pain level and cognitive status). The results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies should also focus on the implementation of algorithms and their impact in clinical practice.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the abstract and full-score findings, the scoring reference points for evaluating the main findings of the study on algorithm-based pain management in people with dementia are structured as follows:\n\n- **Effectiveness Relative to Pain Education**:\n  - Inconclusive evidence on the overall effectiveness of algorithm-based interventions over pain education due to variability in studies and participant baselines.\n  - Low-certainty evidence suggests little to no effect on self-rated pain intensity when compared to pain education.\n  - Very low-certainty evidence suggests that algorithm-based interventions may not significantly reduce challenging behavior when compared to pain education.\n\n- **Effectiveness Relative to Usual Care**:\n  - Low-certainty evidence indicates the intervention may reduce proxy-rated pain intensity compared to usual care, suggesting potential effectiveness.\n  \n- **Evidence Quality**:\n  - Overall low quality of evidence, mainly due to small study sizes, inconsistent pain severity at baseline, and methodological limitations.\n  - High risk of detection bias noted in one study, while uncertainty in selection and performance biases exists across the studies.\n\n- **Outcome Specificity**:\n  - Proxy-rated pain shows more potential for reduction under algorithm-based interventions compared to usual care, but not in comparison to pain education.\n  - Lack of systematic assessment and reporting on adverse effects or serious adverse effects, making conclusions about safety difficult.\n\n- **General Findings**:\n  - Insufficient evidence to clearly support an advantage of algorithm-based pain management interventions over pain education in reducing pain intensity or challenging behavior.\n  - Clinical heterogeneity among study populations, including differences in pain levels and cognitive impairment, complicates broader application of findings.\n\n- **Recommendations for Future Research**:\n  - Further studies should focus on the practical implementation of these algorithms in clinical settings and their impact on various clinical outcomes.\n  - Emphasis on larger, more methodologically sound studies to strengthen certainty and generalizability of results."

    "query": "Title: Pharmacotherapy for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder. Evidence that PTSD is characterised by specific psychobiological dysfunctions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medication in its treatment. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of medication for reducing PTSD symptoms in adults with PTSD. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 11, November 2020); MEDLINE (1946‐), Embase (1974‐), PsycINFO (1967‐) and PTSDPubs (all available years) either directly or via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR). We also searched international trial registers. The date of the latest search was 13 November 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy for adults with PTSD. \nData collection and analysis:\nThree review authors (TW, JI, and NP) independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. We contacted investigators to obtain missing data. We stratified summary statistics by medication class, and by medication agent for all medications. We calculated dichotomous and continuous measures using a random‐effects model, and assessed heterogeneity. \nMain results:\nWe include 66 RCTs in the review (range: 13 days to 28 weeks; 7442 participants; age range 18 to 85 years) and 54 in the meta‐analysis.  For the primary outcome of treatment response, we found evidence of beneficial effect for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.74; 8 studies, 1078 participants), which improved PTSD symptoms in 58% of SSRI participants compared with 35% of placebo participants, based on moderate‐certainty evidence.  For this outcome we also found evidence of beneficial effect for the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) mirtazapine: (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.94; 1 study, 26 participants) in 65% of people on mirtazapine compared with 22% of placebo participants, and for the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) amitriptyline (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.96; 1 study, 40 participants) in 50% of amitriptyline participants compared with 17% of placebo participants, which improved PTSD symptoms. These outcomes are based on low‐certainty evidence. There was however no evidence of beneficial effect for the number of participants who improved with the antipsychotics (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.67; 2 studies, 43 participants) compared to placebo, based on very low‐certainty evidence. For the outcome of treatment withdrawal, we found evidence of a harm for the individual SSRI agents compared with placebo (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87; 14 studies, 2399 participants). Withdrawals were also higher for the separate SSRI paroxetine group compared to the placebo group (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.29; 5 studies, 1101 participants). Nonetheless, the absolute proportion of individuals dropping out from treatment due to adverse events in the SSRI groups was low (9%), based on moderate‐certainty evidence. For the rest of the medications compared to placebo, we did not find evidence of harm for individuals dropping out from treatment due to adverse events. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThe findings of this review support the conclusion that SSRIs improve PTSD symptoms; they are first‐line agents for the pharmacotherapy of PTSD, based on moderate‐certainty evidence. The NaSSA mirtazapine and the TCA amitriptyline may also improve PTSD symptoms, but this is based on low‐certainty evidence. In addition, we found no evidence of benefit for the number of participants who improved following treatment with the antipsychotic group compared to placebo, based on very low‐certainty evidence. There remain important gaps in the evidence base, and a continued need for more effective agents in the management of PTSD.",

    "query": "Title: Early pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPost‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and debilitating condition. Several pharmacological interventions have been proposed with the aim to prevent or mitigate it. These interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability, given that not all individuals exposed to a traumatic event will develop PTSD. There are different possible approaches to preventing PTSD; universal prevention is aimed at individuals at risk of developing PTSD on the basis of having been exposed to a traumatic event, irrespective of whether they are showing signs of psychological difficulties. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of PTSD in adults exposed to a traumatic event. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 13 November 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised clinical trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. In a random‐effects model, we analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH). We analysed continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). \nMain results:\nWe included 13 studies which considered eight interventions (hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare enteral formula, Oxepa enteral formula and 5‐hydroxytryptophan) and involved 2023 participants, with a single trial contributing 1244 participants. Eight studies enrolled participants from emergency departments or trauma centres or similar settings. Participants were exposed to a range of both intentional and unintentional traumatic events. Five studies considered participants in the context of intensive care units with traumatic events consisting of severe physical illness. Our concerns about risk of bias in the included studies were mostly due to high attrition and possible selective reporting. We could meta‐analyse data for two comparisons: hydrocortisone versus placebo, but limited to secondary outcomes; and propranolol versus placebo. No study compared hydrocortisone to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event. The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms compared to placebo at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, serious inconsistency amongst the studies' results, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (SMD ‐0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.61 to 0.59; I 2  = 83%; 3 studies, 86 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study provided data on dropout rates due to side effects at three months post‐traumatic event. The evidence on whether propranolol was more effective than placebo in reducing the probability of experiencing PTSD at three months after the traumatic event is inconclusive, because of serious risk of bias amongst the included studies, and very serious imprecision of the estimate of effect (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92; 3 studies, 88 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No study assessed functional disability or quality of life.  Only one study compared gabapentin to placebo at the primary endpoint of three months after the traumatic event, with inconclusive evidence in terms of both PTSD severity and probability of experiencing PTSD, because of imprecision of the effect estimate, serious risk of bias and serious imprecision (very low‐certainty evidence). We found no data on dropout rates due to side effects, functional disability or quality of life. For the remaining comparisons, the available data are inconclusive or missing in terms of PTSD severity reduction and dropout rates due to adverse events. No study assessed functional disability. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review provides uncertain evidence only regarding the use of hydrocortisone, propranolol, dexamethasone, omega‐3 fatty acids, gabapentin, paroxetine, PulmoCare formula, Oxepa formula, or 5‐hydroxytryptophan as universal PTSD prevention strategies. Future research might benefit from larger samples, better reporting of side effects and inclusion of quality of life and functioning measures.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the given abstract and full-score answers, a complete set of scoring reference points for assessing the main findings would be:\n\n- **Uncertainty and Limitations**: Evaluate the overall uncertainty in the evidence due to identified issues such as risk of bias, inconsistency across studies, and imprecision in effect estimates.\n- **Propranolol Efficacy**: Assess the inconclusive evidence related to propranolol's impact on reducing PTSD severity and probability of developing PTSD three months post-traumatic event.\n- **Gabapentin Efficacy**: Consider the inconclusive evidence regarding gabapentin's effect on reducing PTSD severity and likelihood of developing PTSD three months after a traumatic event.\n- **Functional Disability and Quality of Life Data**: Note the absence of comprehensive data on functional disability and quality of life outcomes across all interventions analyzed.\n- **Dropout Rates and Side Effects**: Record the lack of available data on dropout rates due to side effects for the pharmacological interventions studied.\n- **Hydrocortisone and Other Interventions**: Highlight the inconclusive evidence for interventions like hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, omega-3 fatty acids, paroxetine, PulmoCare formula, Oxepa formula, and 5-hydroxytryptophan.\n- **Sample Size and Study Power**: Identify the need for larger sample sizes and better study designs to improve precision and reliability in future research.\n- **Bias and Reporting Concerns**: Document concerns about high attrition rates and possible selective reporting that affect the robustness of the study findings.\n- **Overall Conclusion on Universal Prevention**: Provide an overall qualitative assessment of the pharmacological interventions as currently uncertain for universal PTSD prevention strategies, indicating areas for future research improvements."

    "query": "Title: Antipsychotics for agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nTypical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia. However, whether or not they are beneficial is uncertain. Some trials have yielded negative results and effectiveness may be outweighed by harms. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's meta‐register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021. Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐arm trials comparing the effects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting. (The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline. We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short‐term sedation. We also excluded head‐to‐head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials. \nData collection and analysis:\nThe primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death. Two review authors independently extracted the necessary data and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated the pooled effect on agitation and psychosis for typical and atypical antipsychotics separately, and the pooled risk of adverse effects independent of the target symptom (agitation or psychosis). We used RevMan Web for the analyses. \nMain results:\nThe search yielded 8233 separate hits. After assessing the full‐text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria. Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis. Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis. Two trials tested both drug types. Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease specifically. The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study). The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community‐dwelling patients, or a combination of those. For typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.57 to ‐0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low‐certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD ‐0.29, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.03, 2studies, n= 240; low‐certainty evidence) compared with placebo. These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderate‐certainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high‐certainty) evidence. There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event. The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low. The effect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.30 to ‐0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate‐certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible effect on psychosis (SMD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate‐certainty evidence). These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n ‐ 3878; high‐certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate‐certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n= 4316; moderate‐certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n= 5032; moderate‐certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise. The drugs probably have a negligible effect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate‐certainty evidence). The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia. Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their effect on psychosis in dementia is negligible. The apparent effectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups. Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events. If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative.",

    "query": "Title: Pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nEvidence is limited regarding the most effective pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression: monotherapy with an antidepressant, monotherapy with an antipsychotic, another treatment (e.g. mifepristone), or combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2015. \nObjectives:\n1. To compare the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with an acute psychotic depression: antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy, mifepristone monotherapy, and the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic versus placebo and/or each other. 2. To assess whether differences in response to treatment in the current episode are related to non‐response to prior treatment. \nSearch methods:\nA search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR); Ovid MEDLINE (1950‐); Embase (1974‐); and PsycINFO (1960‐) was conducted on 21 February 2020. Reference lists of all included studies and related reviews were screened and key study authors contacted. \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included participants with acute major depression with psychotic features, as well as RCTs consisting of participants with acute major depression with or without psychotic features, that reported separately on the subgroup of participants with psychotic features. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to criteria from the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Data were entered into RevMan 5.1. We used intention‐to‐treat data. Primary outcomes were clinical response for efficacy and overall dropout rate for harm/tolerance. Secondary outcome were remission of depression, change from baseline severity score, quality of life, and dropout rate due to adverse effects. For dichotomous efficacy outcomes (i.e. response and overall dropout), risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.  Regarding the primary outcome of harm, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies. If the study did not report any of the response criteria as defined above, remission as defined here could be used as an alternative. For continuously distributed outcomes, it was not possible to extract data from the RCTs.  \nMain results:\nThe search identified 3947 abstracts, but only 12 RCTs with a total of 929 participants could be included in the review. Because of clinical heterogeneity, few meta‐analyses were possible. The main outcome was reduction in severity (response) of depression, not of psychosis. For depression response, we found no evidence of a difference between antidepressant and placebo (RR 8.40, 95% CI 0.50 to 142.27; participants = 27, studies = 1; very low‐certainty evidence) or between antipsychotic and placebo (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.73; participants = 201, studies = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). Furthermore, we found no evidence of a difference in overall dropouts with antidepressant (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.51; participants = 27, studies = 1; very low‐certainty evidence) or antipsychotic monotherapy (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.08; participants = 201, studies = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). No evidence suggests a difference in depression response (RR 2.09, 95% CI 0.64 to 6.82; participants = 36, studies = 1; very low‐certainty evidence) or overall dropouts (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.18 to 18.02; participants = 36, studies = 1; very low‐certainty evidence) between antidepressant and antipsychotic. For depression response, low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic may be more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.38; participants = 447, studies = 4), more effective than antidepressant monotherapy (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.80; participants = 245, studies = 5), and more effective than placebo (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.82; participants = 148, studies = 2). Very low‐certainty evidence suggests no difference in overall dropouts between the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic versus antipsychotic monotherapy (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01; participants = 447, studies = 4), antidepressant monotherapy (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.50; participants = 245, studies = 5), or placebo alone (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.18; participants = 148, studies = 2). No study measured change in depression severity from baseline, quality of life, or dropouts due to adverse events. We found no RCTs with mifepristone that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias is considerable: we noted differences between studies with regards to diagnosis, uncertainties around randomisation and allocation concealment, treatment interventions (pharmacological differences between various antidepressants and antipsychotics), and outcome criteria. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nPsychotic depression is heavily under‐studied, limiting confidence in the conclusions drawn. Some evidence indicates that combination therapy with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than either treatment alone or placebo. Evidence is limited for treatment with an antidepressant alone or with an antipsychotic alone. Evidence for efficacy of mifepristone is lacking.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Combination Therapy Effectiveness:** Evidence suggests that combined therapy with an antidepressant and an antipsychotic is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy, or placebo in improving depression response. However, this evidence is of low to very low certainty due to various clinical and methodological issues.\n\n- **No Significant Difference in Dropout Rates:** There is no significant evidence of differences in overall dropout rates between combination therapy (antidepressant plus antipsychotic) and other treatment options such as antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy, or placebo.\n\n- **Lack of Data on Mifepristone and Other Outcomes:** The review did not find substantial evidence for the efficacy of mifepristone in treating psychotic depression. Additionally, no studies measured changes in depression severity from baseline, quality of life, or dropout rates due to adverse effects.\n\n- **Considerable Risk of Bias:** The studies included in the review face a significant risk of bias, affected by factors like inconsistencies in diagnosis, variability in treatment approaches, and methodological issues such as uncertainties around randomization and allocation concealment.\n\n- **Heterogeneity of Evidence:** The evidence is limited due to clinical heterogeneity among the included studies, impacting the ability to draw confident conclusions.\n\nThese points outline the primary findings regarding the effectiveness and challenges of pharmacological treatments for psychotic depression as presented in the abstract and main findings of the study."

    "query": "Title: Pre‐deployment programmes for building resilience in military and frontline emergency service personnel\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMilitary personnel and frontline emergency workers may be exposed to events that have the potential to precipitate negative mental health outcomes such as depression, symptoms of post‐traumatic stress and even post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Programmes have been designed to build psychological resilience before staff are deployed into the field. This review presents a synthesis of the literature on these “pre‐deployment resilience‐building programmes”. \nObjectives:\nThe objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of programmes that seek to build resilience to potentially traumatic events among military and frontline emergency service personnel prior to their deployment. These resilience programmes were compared to other interventions, treatment as usual or no intervention. \nSearch methods:\nStudies were identified through searches of electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The initial search took place in January 2019, with an updated search completed at the end of September 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nOnly studies that used a randomised controlled trial (RCT)/cluster‐RCT methodology were included. The programmes being evaluated must have sought to build resilience prior to exposure to trauma. Study participants must have been 18 years or older and be military personnel or frontline emergency workers. \nData collection and analysis:\nStudies that met the inclusion criteria were assembled. Data extracted included methods, participants’ details, intervention details, comparator details, and information on outcomes. The primary outcomes of interest were resilience, symptoms of post‐traumatic stress and PTSD. Secondary outcomes of interest included acute stress disorder, depression, social support, coping skills, emotional flexibility, self‐efficacy, social functioning, subjective levels of aggression, quality of sleep, quality of life and stress. Assessment of risk of bias was also completed. A total of 28 studies were included in a narrative synthesis of results. \nMain results:\nAll 28 included studies compared an experimental resilience building intervention versus a control or no intervention. There was a wide range of therapeutic modalities used, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) informed programmes, biofeedback based programmes, stress‐management programmes, mindfulness and relaxation programmes, neuropsychological‐based programmes, and psychoeducational‐informed programmes. The main outcomes are specified here, secondary outcomes such as depression, social support, coping skills, self‐efficacy, subjective levels of aggression and stress are reported in text. No studies reported on the following pre‐specified outcomes; acute stress disorder, emotional flexibility, social functioning, quality of sleep and quality of life. Resilience Eight studies reported resilience as an outcome. We narratively synthesised the data from these studies and our findings show that five of these interventions had success in building resilience in their respective samples. Two of the studies that reported significant results utilised a CBT approach to build resilience, while the other three successful programmes were mindfulness‐based interventions. Symptoms of post‐traumatic stress Our narrative synthesis of results included eight studies. Two of the eight studies produced significant reductions in symptoms of post traumatic stress compared to controls. These interventions used neuropsychological and biofeedback intervention models respectively. PTSD caseness Four studies reported PTSD caseness as an outcome. Our narrative synthesis of results suggests that evidence is mixed as to the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing clinical diagnosis of PTSD. One study of a neuropsychology‐orientated Attention Bias Modification Training (AMBT) programme had success in reducing both symptoms of post‐traumatic stress and numbers of participants receiving a diagnosis of PTSD. A stress‐management programme reported that, when baseline differences in rates of pre‐deployment mental health issues were controlled for, participants in the control condition were at 6.9 times the risk of a diagnosis of PTSD when compared to the intervention group. Given the diversity of intervention designs and theoretical orientations used (which included stress‐management, neuropsychological and psychoeducational programmes), a definitive statement on the efficacy of pre‐deployment programmes at reducing symptoms of post‐traumatic stress and PTSD cannot be confidently offered. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWhile a number of evaluations of relevant programmes have been published, the quality of these evaluations limits our ability to determine if resilience‐building programmes 'work' in terms of preventing negative outcomes such as depression, symptoms of post‐traumatic stress and diagnoses of PTSD. Based on our findings we recommend that future research should: a) report pre‐/post‐means and standard deviation scores for scales used within respective studies, b) take the form of large, RCTs with protocols published in advance, and c) seek to measure defined psychological facets such as resilience, PTSD and stress, and measure these concepts using established psychometric tools. This will provide more certainty in future assessments of the evidence base. From a clinical implications point of view, overall there is mixed evidence that the interventions included in this review are effective at safe guarding military personnel or frontline emergency workers from experiencing negative mental health outcomes, including PTSD, following exposure to potentially traumatic events. Based on this, practitioners seeking to build resilience in their personnel need to be aware of the limitations of the evidence base. Practitioners should have modest expectations in relation to the efficacy of resilience‐building programmes as a prophylactic approach to employment‐related critical incident traumas.",

    "query": "Title: Non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non‐ICU patients\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDelirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited and so prevention of delirium is desirable. Non‐pharmacological interventions are thought to be important in delirium prevention.  \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness of non‐pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU). \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non‐pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium.  \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently examined titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full‐text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved by consensus. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were: incidence of delirium; inpatient and later mortality; and new diagnosis of dementia. We included secondary and adverse outcomes as pre‐specified in the review protocol. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and between‐group mean differences for continuous outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. A complementary exploratory analysis was undertaker using a Bayesian component network meta‐analysis fixed‐effect model to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the individual components of multicomponent interventions and describe which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium. \nMain results:\nWe included 22 RCTs that recruited a total of 5718 adult participants. Fourteen trials compared a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention with usual care. Two trials compared liberal and restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. The remaining six trials each investigated a different non‐pharmacological intervention. Incidence of delirium was reported in all studies.  Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, we identified risks of bias in all included trials. All were at high risk of performance bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to the interventions. Nine trials were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors and three more were at unclear risk in this domain.  Pooled data showed that multi‐component non‐pharmacological interventions probably reduce the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (10.5% incidence in the intervention group, compared to 18.4% in the control group, risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.71, I 2  = 39%; 14 studies; 3693 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias).  There may be little or no effect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality compared to usual care (5.2% in the intervention group, compared to 4.5% in the control group, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.74, I 2  = 15%; 10 studies; 2640 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision).  No studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnoses of dementia.  Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction of around a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean difference (MD) ‐0.93, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 0.14 days, I 2  = 65%; 351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of multicomponent interventions on delirium severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.49, 95% CI ‐1.13 to 0.14, I 2 =64%; 147 participants; very low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision). Multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD ‐1.30 days, 95% CI ‐2.56 to ‐0.04 days, I 2 =91%; 3351 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency), but little to no difference in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Reporting of other adverse outcomes was limited.  Our exploratory component network meta‐analysis found that re‐orientation (including use of familiar objects), cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care were probably associated with a reduction in incident delirium but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm.  Reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation and pain control all had summary estimates that suggested potential increases in delirium incidence, but the uncertainty in the estimates was substantial.  Evidence from two trials suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold probably results in little to no difference in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.36; I 2  = 9%; 294 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias).  Six other interventions were examined, but evidence for each was limited to single studies and we identified no evidence of delirium prevention.  \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is moderate‐certainty evidence regarding the benefit of multicomponent non‐pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, estimated to reduce incidence by 43% compared to usual care. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality. There is emerging evidence that these interventions may reduce hospital length of stay, with a trend towards reduced delirium duration, although the effect on delirium severity remains uncertain. Further research should focus on implementation and detailed analysis of the components of the interventions to support more effective, tailored practice recommendations.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the psychiatry abstract and the full-score contributions, here is a comprehensive set of scoring reference points for the main findings:\n\n- **Reduction in Delirium Incidence:**\n  - Moderate-certainty evidence supports that multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions likely reduce the incidence of delirium by approximately 43% compared to usual care (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.71).\n\n- **Impact on Mortality and Dementia Diagnosis:**\n  - There is low to moderate-certainty evidence that these interventions may have little or no effect on inpatient mortality (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.74) and no studies reported data on the development of new dementia diagnoses.\n\n- **Hospital Length of Stay:**\n  - Multicomponent interventions may reduce hospital length of stay by about 1.30 days compared to usual care, with low-certainty evidence due to risk of bias and inconsistency (MD -1.30 days, 95% CI -2.56 to -0.04).\n\n- **Duration of Delirium Episode:**\n  - There may be a modest reduction in the duration of delirium episodes by approximately one day, supported by low-certainty evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision (MD -0.93 days, 95% CI -2.01 to 0.14).\n\n- **Severity of Delirium:**\n  - There is very low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of multicomponent interventions on delirium severity, with significant uncertainty (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -1.13 to 0.14).\n\n- **Individual Intervention Components:**\n  - Re-orientation, cognitive stimulation, and sleep hygiene are associated with lower risk of delirium incidence, while the impact of other components such as nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, and medication review remains inconclusive without definitive conclusions.\n\n- **Risk of Bias in Trials:**\n  - All included trials had a high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, with additional high risk or unclear risk of detection bias.\n\n- **Sub-analysis and Uncertainty:**\n  - Exploratory analysis suggested potential associations between certain components and reduced delirium risk, but overall uncertainty remains due to bias and limited data from individual studies."

    "query": "Title: Omega‐3 fatty acids for depression in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is highly debilitating, difficult to treat, has a high rate of recurrence, and negatively impacts the individual and society as a whole. One potential treatment for MDD is n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n‐3PUFAs), also known as omega‐3 oils, naturally found in fatty fish, some other seafood, and some nuts and seeds. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for n‐3PUFAs in MDD, but the evidence is far from conclusive. Reviews and meta‐analyses clearly demonstrate heterogeneity between studies. Investigations of heterogeneity suggest different effects of n‐3PUFAs, depending on the severity of depressive symptoms, where no effects of n‐3PUFAs are found in studies of individuals with mild depressive symptomology, but possible benefit may be suggested in studies of individuals with more severe depressive symptomology. Hence it is important to establish their effectiveness in treating MDD. This review updates and incorporates an earlier review with the same research objective (Appleton 2015). \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also known as omega‐3 fatty acids) versus a comparator (e.g. placebo, antidepressant treatment, standard care, no treatment, wait‐list control) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO together with trial registries and grey literature sources (to 9 January 2021). We checked reference lists and contacted authors of included studies for additional information when necessary. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included studies in the review if they: used a randomised controlled trial design; provided n‐3PUFAs as an intervention; used a comparator; measured depressive symptomology as an outcome; and were conducted in adults with MDD. Primary outcomes were depressive symptomology (continuous data collected using a validated rating scale) and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptomology (dichotomous data on remission and response), quality of life, and non‐completion of studies. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. \nMain results:\nThe review includes 35 relevant studies: 34 studies involving a total of 1924 participants investigated the impact of n‐3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo, and one study involving 40 participants investigated the impact of n‐3PUFA supplementation compared to antidepressant treatment. For the placebo comparison, n‐3PUFA supplementation resulted in a small to modest benefit for depressive symptomology, compared to placebo: standardised mean difference (SMD) (random‐effects model) −0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.64 to −0.16; 33 studies, 1848 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but this effect is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. An SMD of 0.40 represents a difference between groups in scores on the HDRS (17‐item) of approximately 2.5 points (95% CI 1.0 to 4.0), where the minimal clinically important change score on this scale is 3.0 points. The confidence intervals include both a possible clinically important effect and a possible negligible effect, and there is considerable heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analyses, funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well‐conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate may be biased towards a positive finding for n‐3PUFAs. Although the numbers of individuals experiencing adverse events were similar in intervention and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.64; 24 studies, 1503 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), the confidence intervals include a small decrease to a modest increase in adverse events with n‐3PUFAs. There was no evidence for a difference between n‐3PUFA and placebo groups in remission rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.72; 8 studies, 609 participants, low‐certainty evidence), response rates (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.79; 17 studies, 794 participants; low‐certainty evidence), quality of life (SMD −0.38 (95% CI −0.82 to 0.06), 12 studies, 476 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), or trial non‐completion (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22; 29 studies, 1777 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). The evidence on which these results are based was also very limited, highly heterogeneous, and potentially biased. Only one study, involving 40 participants, was available for the antidepressant comparison. This study found no differences between treatment with n‐3PUFAs and treatment with antidepressants in depressive symptomology (mean difference (MD) −0.70, 95% CI −5.88 to 4.48), rates of response to treatment (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.31), or trial non‐completion (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.71). Confidence intervals are however very wide in all analyses, and do not rule out important beneficial or detrimental effects of n‐3PUFAs compared to antidepressants. Adverse events were not reported in a manner suitable for analysis, and rates of depression remission and quality of life were not reported. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nAt present, we do not have sufficient high‐certainty evidence to determine the effects of n‐3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD. Our primary analyses may suggest a small‐to‐modest, non‐clinically beneficial effect of n‐3PUFAs on depressive symptomology compared to placebo; however the estimate is imprecise, and we judged the certainty of the evidence on which this result is based to be low to very low. Our data may also suggest similar rates of adverse events and trial non‐completion in n‐3PUFA and placebo groups, but again our estimates are very imprecise. Effects of n‐3PUFAs compared to antidepressants are very imprecise and uncertain. More complete evidence is required for both the potential positive and negative effects of n‐3PUFAs for MDD.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Small to Modest Benefit for Depressive Symptoms:**\n  - n‐3PUFA supplementation compared to placebo showed a standardized mean difference (SMD) of ‐0.40 (95% CI ‐0.64 to ‐0.16), indicating a small to modest benefit in depressive symptoms, but this is unlikely to be clinically meaningful.\n\n- **Heterogeneity and Low Certainty Evidence:**\n  - High heterogeneity observed across studies with low to very low certainty in the evidence. The potential exists for bias in findings toward a positive effect of n‐3PUFAs.\n\n- **Adverse Event Rates:**\n  - Adverse event rates similar between n‐3PUFA and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.64), with confidence intervals encompassing both potential decreases and increases.\n\n- **Response and Remission Rates:**\n  - No significant differences found between n‐3PUFA and placebo groups in remission rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.72) or response rates (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.79).\n\n- **Quality of Life and Trial Non-Completion:**\n  - No notable differences between n‐3PUFA and placebo groups in quality of life outcomes (SMD ‐0.38 (95% CI ‐0.82 to 0.06)) or trial non‐completion rates (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22).\n\n- **Comparison with Antidepressants:**\n  - One study compared n‐3PUFA supplementation with antidepressant treatment, showing no differences in depressive symptomology (mean difference (MD) -0.70, 95% CI -5.88 to 4.48) and response rates (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.31).\n\n- **Imprecise and Limited Evidence:**\n  - Overall, very imprecise evidence and wide confidence intervals in the comparison of n‐3PUFAs with antidepressants. Lack of reported data on adverse events, remission rates, and quality of life in this context.\n\n- **Conclusion on Certainty of Evidence:**\n  - Present evidence is insufficient with low to very low certainty to determine firm effects of n‐3PUFAs as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).\n  \nEach bullet point captures a distinct criterion from the findings, focusing on effects, certainty, comparisons, and the overall reliability of the results."

    "query": "Title: Multi‐domain interventions for the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. Currently, no effective medical treatment exists to cure or to delay the onset of cognitive decline or dementia. Up to 40% of dementia is attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors, which has led to the notion that targeting these risk factors might reduce the incidence of cognitive decline and dementia. Since sporadic dementia is a multifactorial condition, thought to derive from multiple causes and risk factors, multi‐domain interventions may be more effective for the prevention of dementia than those targeting single risk factors. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of multi‐domain interventions for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults, including both unselected populations and populations at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), and ClinicalTrials.gov on 28 April 2021. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies, landmark papers, and review papers to identify additional studies and assessed their suitability for inclusion in the review. \nSelection criteria:\nWe defined a multi‐domain intervention as an intervention with more than one component, pharmacological or non‐pharmacological, but not consisting only of two or more drugs with the same therapeutic target. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of such an intervention on cognitive functioning and/or incident dementia. We accepted as control conditions any sham intervention or usual care, but not single‐domain interventions intended to reduce dementia risk. We required studies to have a minimum of 400 participants and an intervention and follow‐up duration of at least 12 months. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe initially screened search results using a ‘crowdsourcing’ method in which members of Cochrane’s citizen science platform identify RCTs. We screened the identified citations against inclusion criteria by two review authors working independently. At least two review authors also independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. We defined high‐certainty reviews as trials with a low risk of bias across all domains other than blinding of participants and personnel involved in administering the intervention (because lifestyle interventions are difficult to blind). Critical outcomes were incident dementia, incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive decline measured with any validated measure, and mortality. Important outcomes included adverse events (e.g. cardiovascular events), quality of life, and activities of daily living (ADL).  Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random‐effects meta‐analyses. We expressed treatment effects as risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \nMain results:\nWe included nine RCTs (18.452 participants) in this review. Two studies reported incident dementia as an outcome; all nine studies reported a measure for cognitive functioning. Assessment of cognitive functioning was very heterogeneous across studies, ranging from complete neuropsychological assessments to short screening tests such as the mini‐mental state examination (MMSE). The duration of the interventions varied from 12 months to 10 years. We compared multi‐domain interventions against usual care or a sham intervention. Positive MDs and RRs <1 favour multi‐domain interventions over control interventions. For incident dementia, there was no evidence of a difference between the multi‐domain intervention group and the control group (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 2 studies; 7256 participants; high‐certainty evidence). There was a small difference in composite Z‐score for cognitive function measured with a neuropsychological test battery (NTB) (MD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.06; 3 studies; 4617 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale (MD 0.76 point, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.46; 2 studies; 1554 participants), but the certainty of evidence for the MoCA was very low (due to serious risk of bias, inconsistency and indirectness) and there was no evidence of an effect on the MMSE (MD 0.02 point, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.09; 6 studies; 8697participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of an effect on mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 4 studies; 11,487 participants; high‐certainty evidence). There was high‐certainty evidence for an interaction of the multi‐domain intervention with ApoE4 status on the outcome of cognitive function measured with an NTB (carriers MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.25, noncarriers MD 0.04, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.10, P for interaction 0.09). There was no clear evidence for an interaction with baseline cognitive status (defined by MMSE‐score) on cognitive function measured with an NTB (low baseline MMSE group MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11, high baseline MMSE group MD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.04, P for interaction 0.12), nor was there clear evidence for an effect in participants with a Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score > 6 points (MD 0.07, 95%CI ‐0.00 to 0.15). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found no evidence that multi‐domain interventions can prevent incident dementia based on two trials. There was a small improvement in cognitive function assessed by a NTB in the group of participants receiving a multi‐domain intervention, although this effect was strongest in trials offering cognitive training within the multi‐domain intervention, making it difficult to rule out a potential learning effect. Interventions were diverse in terms of their components and intensity.",

    "query": "Title: Humour‐based interventions for people with schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nHumour‐based interventions are defined as any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression, or appreciation of the absurdity or incongruity of life's situations. Humour‐based interventions can be implemented in different settings, including hospitals, nursing homes and day care centres. They have been posed as an adjunct to usual care for people with schizophrenia, but a summary of the evidence is lacking. \nObjectives:\nTo examine the effects of humour‐based interventions as an add‐on intervention to standard care for people with schizophrenia. \nSearch methods:\nOn 31 July 2019 and 10 February 2021 we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based register of trials, which is based on CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and WHO ICTRP. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials comparing humour‐based interventions with active controls, other psychological interventions, or standard care for people with schizophrenia. We excluded studies fulfilling our prespecified selection criteria but without useable data from further quantitative synthesis. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality, following the guidance from the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . For binary outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean differences (MDs) and their 95% CIs. We assessed risks of bias for included studies and created summary of findings tables using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included three studies in this review for qualitative synthesis, although one study did not report any relevant outcomes. We therefore include two studies (n = 96) in our quantitative synthesis. No data were available on the following prespecified primary outcomes: clinically‐important change in general mental state, clinically‐important change in negative symptoms, clinically‐important change in overall quality of life, and adverse effects. As compared with active control, humour‐based interventions may not improve the average endpoint score of a general mental state scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score: MD −1.70, 95% CI −17.01 to 13.61; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence); positive symptoms (PANSS positive symptom score: MD 0.00, 95% CI −2.58 to 2.58; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence), negative symptoms (PANSS negative symptom score: MD −0.70, 95% CI −4.22 to 2.82; 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence) and anxiety (State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): MD −2.60, 95% CI −5.76 to 0.56; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Due to the small sample size, we remain uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early as compared with active control (no event, 1 study, 30 participants; very low certainty of evidence). On the other hand, humour‐based interventions may reduce depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): MD −6.20, 95% CI −12.08 to −0.32; 1 study, 30 participants; low certainty of evidence). Compared with standard care, humour‐based interventions may not improve  depressive symptoms (BDI second edition: MD 0.80, 95% CI −2.64 to 4.24; 1 study, 59 participants; low certainty of evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of humour‐based interventions on leaving the study early for any reason compared with standard care (risk ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.80; 1 study, 66 participants; very low certainty of evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe are currently uncertain whether the evidence supports the use of humour‐based interventions in people with schizophrenia.

This is an update of the 2015 Cochrane Review for the use of glutamate receptor modulators for depression in bipolar disorder. \nObjectives:\n1. To assess the effects of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with bipolar disorder. 2. To review the acceptability of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in people with bipolar disorder who are experiencing depressive symptoms. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO all years to July 2020.  We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. \nSelection criteria:\nRCTs comparing ketamine or other glutamate receptor modulators with other active psychotropic drugs or saline placebo in adults with bipolar depression. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were response rate and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included remission rate, depression severity change scores, suicidality, cognition, quality of life, and dropout rate. The GRADE framework was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. \nMain results:\nTen studies (647 participants) were included in this review (an additional five studies compared to the 2015 review). There were no additional studies added to the comparisons identified in the 2015 Cochrane review on ketamine, memantine and cytidine versus placebo. However, three new comparisons were found: ketamine versus midazolam, N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, and riluzole versus placebo. The glutamate receptor modulators studied were ketamine (three trials), memantine (two), cytidine (one), N‐acetylcysteine (three), and riluzole (one). Eight of these studies were placebo‐controlled and two‐armed. In seven trials the glutamate receptor modulators had been used as add‐on drugs to mood stabilisers. Only one trial compared ketamine with an active comparator, midazolam. The treatment period ranged from a single intravenous administration (all ketamine studies), to repeated administration for riluzole, memantine, cytidine, and N‐acetylcysteine (with a follow‐up of eight weeks, 8 to 12 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 to 20 weeks, respectively). Six of the studies included sites in the USA, one in Taiwan, one in Denmark, one in Australia, and in one study the location was unclear. All participants had a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder and were experiencing an acute bipolar depressive episode, diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (IV) or fourth edition text revision (IV‐TR). Among all glutamate receptor modulators included in this review, only ketamine appeared to be more efficacious than placebo 24 hours after infusion for response rate (odds ratio (OR) 11.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 107.74; P = 0.03; participants = 33; studies = 2; I² = 0%, low‐certainty evidence). Ketamine seemed to be more effective in reducing depression rating scale scores (MD ‐11.81, 95% CI ‐20.01 to ‐3.61; P = 0.005; participants = 32; studies = 2; I 2  = 0%, very low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of ketamine's efficacy in producing remission over placebo at 24 hours (OR 5.16, 95% CI 0.51 to 52.30; P = 0.72; participants = 33; studies = 2; I 2  = 0%, very low‐certainty evidence). Evidence on response, remission or depression rating scale scores between ketamine and midazolam was uncertain at 24 hours due to very low‐certainty evidence (OR 3.20, 95% CI 0.23 to 45.19). In the one trial assessing ketamine and midazolam, there were no dropouts due to adverse effects or for any reason (very low‐certainty evidence). Placebo may have been more effective than N‐acetylcysteine in reducing depression rating scale scores at three months, although this was based on very low‐certainty evidence (MD 1.28, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.31; participants = 58; studies = 2). Very uncertain evidence found no difference in response at three months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.14; participants = 69; studies = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for remission or acceptability. Extremely limited data were available for riluzole vs placebo, finding only very‐low certainty evidence of no difference in dropout rates (OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.84; P = 0.46; participants = 19; studies = 1; I 2  = 0%). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nIt is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from this review due to the certainty of the evidence being low to very low, and the relatively small amount of data usable for analysis in bipolar disorder, which is considerably less than the information available for unipolar depression. Nevertheless, we found uncertain evidence in favour of a single intravenous dose of ketamine (as add‐on therapy to mood stabilisers) over placebo in terms of response rate up to 24 hours, however ketamine did not show any better efficacy for remission in bipolar depression. Even though ketamine has the potential to have a rapid and transient antidepressant effect, the efficacy of a single intravenous dose may be limited. We did not find conclusive evidence on adverse events with ketamine, and there was insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators. However, ketamine's psychotomimetic effects (such as delusions or delirium) may have compromised study blinding in some studies, and so we cannot rule out the potential bias introduced by inadequate blinding procedures. To draw more robust conclusions, further methodologically sound RCTs (with adequate blinding) are needed to explore different modes of administration of ketamine, and to study different methods of sustaining antidepressant response, such as repeated administrations.",

    "query": "Title: Palliative care interventions in advanced dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDementia is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease. Advanced dementia is characterised by profound cognitive impairment, inability to communicate verbally and complete functional dependence. Usual care of people with advanced dementia is not underpinned universally by a palliative approach. Palliative care has focused traditionally on care of people with cancer, but for more than a decade, there have been calls worldwide to extend palliative care services to include all people with life‐limiting illnesses in need of specialist care, including people with dementia. This review is an updated version of a review first published in 2016. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effect of palliative care interventions in advanced dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 7 October 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), four other databases and two trial registries on 7 October 2020 to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and as up‐to‐date as possible. \nSelection criteria:\nWe searched for randomised (RCTs) and non‐randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series studies evaluating the impact of palliative care interventions for adults with advanced dementia of any type. Participants could be people with advanced dementia, their family members, clinicians or paid care staff. We included clinical interventions and non‐clinical interventions. Comparators were usual care or another palliative care intervention. We did not exclude studies based on outcomes measured. \nData collection and analysis:\nAt least two review authors (SW, EM, PC) independently assessed all potential studies identified in the search against the review inclusion criteria. Two authors independently extracted data from eligible studies. Where appropriate, we estimated pooled treatment effects in a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE. \nMain results:\nNine studies (2122 participants) met the review inclusion criteria. Two studies were individually‐randomised RCTs, six were cluster‐randomised RCTs and one was a controlled before‐and‐after study. We conducted two separate comparisons: organisation and delivery of care interventions versus usual care (six studies, 1162 participants) and advance care planning interventions versus usual care (three studies, 960 participants). Two studies were carried out in acute hospitals and seven in nursing homes or long‐term care facilities. For both comparisons, we found the included studies to be sufficiently similar to conduct meta‐analyses. Changes to the organisation and delivery of care for people with advanced dementia may increase comfort in dying (MD 1.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.64; 5 studies, 335 participants; very low certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain and unlikely to be clinically significant. These changes may also increase the likelihood of having a palliative care plan in place (RR 5.84, 95% CI 1.37 to 25.02; 1 study, 99 participants; I 2  = 0%; very low certainty evidence), but again the evidence is very uncertain. Such interventions probably have little effect on the use of non‐palliative interventions (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.72; 2 studies, 292 participants; I 2  = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). They may also have little or no effect on documentation of advance directives (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.25; 2 studies, 112 participants; I 2  = 52%; very low certainty evidence), or whether discussions take place about advance care planning (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.18; 1 study, 193 participants; I 2  = 0%; very low certainty evidence) and goals of care (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.54; 1 study, 13 participants; I 2  = 0%; low certainty evidence). No included studies assessed adverse effects. Advance care planning interventions for people with advanced dementia probably increase the documentation of advance directives (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.41; 2 studies, 384; moderate certainty evidence) and the number of discussions about goals of care (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.59; 2 studies, 384 participants; moderate certainty evidence). They may also slightly increase concordance with goals of care (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.79; 1 study, 63 participants; low certainty evidence). On the other hand, they may have little or no effect on perceived symptom management (MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐6.49 to 2.89; 1 study, 67 participants; very low certainty evidence) or whether advance care planning discussions occur (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24; 1 study, 67 participants; low certainty evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThe evidence on palliative care interventions in advanced dementia is limited in quantity and certainty. When compared to usual care, changes to the organisation and delivery of care for people with advanced dementia may lead to improvements in comfort in dying, but the evidence for this was of very low certainty. Advance care planning interventions, compared to usual care, probably increase the documentation of advance directives and the occurrence of discussions about goals of care, and may also increase concordance with goals of care. We did not detect other effects. The uncertainty in the evidence across all outcomes in both comparisons is mainly driven by imprecision of effect estimates and risk of bias in the included studies.",

Here we update a previous Cochrane Review on the effects of medication for TTM. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of medication for trichotillomania (TTM) in adults, children and adolescents compared with placebo or other medication. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, eleven other bibliographic databases, trial registries and grey literature sources (to 26 November 2020). We checked reference lists and contacted subject experts. \nSelection criteria:\nWe selected randomised controlled trials of medication versus placebo or other medication for TTM in adults, children and adolescents. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. \nMain results:\nTwelve studies were included. We identified 10 studies in adults (286 participants) with a mean sample size of 29 participants per trial; one study in children and adolescents (39 participants); and, one study in adults and adolescents (22 participants: 18 adults and 4 adolescents). All studies were single‐centre, outpatient trials. Eleven studies compared medication and placebo (334 participants); one study compared two medications (13 participants). Studies were 5 to 13 weeks duration. We undertook meta‐analysis only for opioid antagonists as other comparisons contained a single study, or reported insufficient data. Antioxidants versus placebo in adults There was little to no difference in treatment response between antioxidant (35.7%) and placebo groups (28.6%) after six weeks, based on a single trial of silymarin (risk ratio (RR) 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 5.99; 36 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (18 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Antioxidants versus placebo in adolescents There was little to no difference in treatment response between antioxidant (50%) and placebo groups (25%) after six weeks, based on a single trial of silymarin (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 14.20; 8 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (8 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Antipsychotics versus placebo in adults There may be greater treatment response in the antipsychotic group (85%) compared to the placebo group (17%) after 12 weeks, based on a single trial of olanzapine (RR 5.08, 95% CI 1.4 to 18.37; 25 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (25 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Cell signal transducers versus placebo in adults There was little to no difference in treatment response between cell signal transducer (42.1%) and placebo groups (31.6%) after 10 weeks, based on a single trial of inositol (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.57 to 3.11; 38 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (38 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Glutamate modulators versus placebo in adults There is probably greater treatment response in the glutamate modulator group (56%) compared to the placebo group (16%) after 12 weeks, based on a single trial of N‐acetylcysteine (RR 3.5, 95% CI 1.34 to 9.17; 50 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (50 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Glutamate modulators versus placebo in children and adolescents There was little to no difference in treatment response between the glutamate modulator (25%) and placebo groups (21.1%) in children and adolescents, based on a single trial of N‐acetylcysteine (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.77; 39 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in dropouts due to adverse events between glutamate modulator (5%) and placebo (0%) groups, based on a single trial (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.12 to 66.11; 39 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Opioid antagonists versus placebo in adults There may be little to no difference in treatment response between opioid antagonist (37.5%) and placebo groups (25%) after six to eight weeks, based on two studies of naltrexone, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.25 to 18.17; 2 studies, 68 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available regarding dropouts due to adverse events. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo in adults There were no data available for treatment response to SSRIs. There was little to no difference in dropouts due to adverse events in the SSRI group (5.1%) compared to the placebo group (0%) after 6 to 12 weeks, based on two trials of fluoxetine (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.62; 2 studies, 78 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with predominantly serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) actions versus placebo in adults There may be greater treatment response in the TCAs with predominantly SRI actions group (40%) compared to the placebo group (0%) after nine weeks, but the evidence is very uncertain, based on a single trial of clomipramine (RR 5.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 90.83; 16 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be increased dropouts due to adverse events in the TCAs with predominantly SRI actions group (30%) compared to the placebo group (0%), but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 4.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 73.81; 16 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). TCAs with predominantly SRI actions versus other TCAs in adults There may be greater treatment response in the TCAs with predominantly SRI actions group compared to the other TCAs group after five weeks, based on a single trial comparing clomipramine to desipramine (mean difference (MD) ‐4.00, 95% CI ‐6.13 to ‐1.87; 26 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We could not calculate differences in number of dropouts as there were no events in either group (26 participants; low‐certainty evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere was insufficient evidence from meta‐analysis to confirm or refute the efficacy of any agent or class of medication for the treatment of TTM in adults, children or adolescents. Preliminary evidence suggests there may be beneficial treatment effects for N‐acetylcysteine, clomipramine and olanzapine in adults based on four trials, albeit with relatively small sample sizes.",

    "query": "Title: Cannabinoids for the treatment of dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDementia is a common chronic condition, mainly affecting older adults, characterised by a progressive decline in cognitive and functional abilities. Medical treatments for dementia are limited. Cannabinoids are being investigated for the treatment of dementia. \nObjectives:\nTo determine the efficacy and safety of cannabinoids for the treatment of dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS ‐ the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register ‐ on 8 July 2021, using the terms cannabis or cannabinoid or endocannabinoid or cannabidiol or THC or CBD or dronabinol or delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol or marijuana or marihuana or hashish. The register contains records from all major healthcare databases (the  Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cannabinoids for the treatment of dementia. We included participants of any age and of either sex with diagnosed dementia of any subtype, or with unspecified dementia of any severity, from any setting. We considered studies of cannabinoids administered by any route, at any dose, for any duration, compared with placebo, no treatment, or any active control intervention. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. When necessary, other review authors were involved in reaching consensus decisions. We conducted meta‐analyses using a generic inverse variance fixed‐effect model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to assess our confidence in the effect estimates. \nMain results:\nWe included four studies (126 participants) in this review. Most participants had Alzheimer's disease; a few had vascular dementia or mixed dementia. Three studies had low risk of bias across all domains; one study had unclear risk of bias for the majority of domains.  The included studies tested natural delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Namisol) and two types of synthetic THC analogue (dronabinol and nabilone). Three trials had a cross‐over design. Interventions were applied over 3 to 14 weeks; one study reported adverse events over 70 weeks of follow‐up. One trial was undertaken in the USA, one in Canada, and two in The Netherlands. Two studies reported non‐commercial funding, and two studies were conducted with the support of both commercial and non‐commercial funding. Primary outcomes in this review were changes in global and specific cognitive function, overall behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and adverse events. We found very low‐certainty evidence suggesting there may be little or no clinically important effect of a synthetic THC analogue on cognition assessed with the standardised Mini‐Mental State Examination (sMMSE) (mean difference (MD) 1.1 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 2.1; 1 cross‐over trial, 28 participants).  We found low‐certainty evidence suggesting there may be little or no clinically important effect of cannabinoids on overall behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (or its modified nursing home version) (MD ‐1.97, 95% CI ‐3.87 to ‐0.07; 1 parallel group and 2 cross‐over studies, 110 participants). All included studies reported data on adverse events. However, the total number of adverse events, the total numbers of mild and moderate adverse events, and the total number of serious adverse events (SAEs) were not reported in a way that permitted meta‐analysis.  There were no clear differences between groups in numbers of adverse events, with the exception of sedation (including lethargy), which was more frequent among participants taking nabilone (N = 17) than placebo (N = 6) (odds ratio (OR) 2.83, 95% CI 1.07 to 7.48; 1 cross‐over study, 38 participants). We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse event outcomes to be low or very low due to serious concerns regarding imprecision and indirectness. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nBased on data from four small, short, and heterogeneous placebo‐controlled trials, we cannot be certain whether cannabinoids have any beneficial or harmful effects on dementia. If there are benefits of cannabinoids for people with dementia, the effects may be too small to be clinically meaningful. Adequately powered, methodologically robust trials with longer follow‐up are needed to properly assess the effects of cannabinoids in dementia.",

    "query": "Title: Lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nBipolar disorder is a chronic mental disorder with repetitive mania/hypomania as well as depressive episodes, which eventually results in marked impairment in overall functioning and health‐related quality of life.  A worldwide prevalence rate of 2.4% has been reported. The risk of suicide is higher in people with bipolar disorder than those with other mental disorders. Therefore, effective management of bipolar disorder in the maintenance period is warranted to minimize the risk of relapse or recurrence. Although lithium has been the standard treatment of bipolar disorder for many years, it is associated with adverse effects and teratogenicity. Lamotrigine is approved to be expected for prevention of recurrence for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. In addition, lamotrigine is as effective as lithium. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to confirm the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialized Register (CCMDCTR) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to 21 May 2021. We also searched international trial registries and contacted experts in the field. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomized controlled trials enrolling adults with bipolar disorder who were treated with lamotrigine, placebo or lithium. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo reviews authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardized form. Data extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in the term of efficacy and tolerability. Study information were then entered into RevMan web. \nMain results:\nWe included 11 studies with a total of 2314 participants in this review; 1146 were randomized to lamotrigine, 869 were randomized to placebo and, 299 to lithium. We rated all studies as having an unclear risk of bias in at least one domain of Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias, with the most commonly observed weakness being selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment). We judged five studies to be at a high risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment). These potential biases pose as major threat to the validity of the included studies in this review. Outcomes of efficacy showed a possible advantage of lamotrigine over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for recurrence of manic symptom at one year as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) was 0.67, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87; 3 studies, 663 participants; low‐certainty evidence) in favor of lamotrigine. The RR of clinical worsening with the need for additional psychotropic treatment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 4 studies, 756 participants) based on moderate‐certainty evidence. The possible benefits of lamotrigine were also seen for the outcome of treatment withdrawal due to any reason at 6‐12 months after treatment (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; 4 studies, 700 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Regarding tolerability, our analyses showed that the incidence rates of adverse effects were similar between the lamotrigine group and the placebo group (short‐term effect: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.42; 5 studies, 1138 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; long‐term effect: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 4 studies, 756 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the comparison between lamotrigine and lithium, efficacy was similar between groups except for recurrence of mania episode at one year. Recurrence of manic symptoms was higher in the lamotrigine group than that of the lithium group (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.44; 3 studies, 602 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Analysis of adverse effects at 6‐12 months showed that a lower proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with lamotrigine compared to lithium (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; 4 studies, 691 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nLow‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence collectively suggests that lamotrigine may be superior to placebo as a treatment modality for bipolar disorder. In comparison to lithium, people with bipolar disorder seem to tolerate lamotrigine better in the long run; however, the demonstrated efficacy in the maintenance of bipolar disorder was similar between the two groups.",
    "reference_answer": "Here is a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings from the abstract on lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder:\n\n- **Efficacy Against Placebo:**\n  - Lamotrigine is superior to placebo in preventing recurrence of manic symptoms (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87) based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence.\n  - Lamotrigine shows a reduced risk of clinical worsening, necessitating additional psychotropic treatment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98) with moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Efficacy Compared to Lithium:**\n  - Overall efficacy of lamotrigine is similar to lithium, except for recurrence of manic episodes.\n  - Recurrence of manic episodes is higher in the lamotrigine group compared to the lithium group (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.44) based on moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Tolerability Findings:**\n  - Short-term incidence rates of adverse effects are similar between lamotrigine and placebo (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.42) with very low-certainty evidence.\n  - Long-term incidence rates of adverse effects in lamotrigine-treated patients are similar to placebo (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23) with moderate-certainty evidence.\n  - Lamotrigine demonstrates a lower incidence of adverse effects compared to lithium over 6-12 months (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96) with moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Treatment Withdrawal:**\n  - Lamotrigine shows possible benefits over the placebo regarding treatment withdrawal due to any reason at 6-12 months after treatment (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99) based on moderate-certainty evidence.\n\nThese points provide clear criteria for evaluating the key clinical outcomes of the utilization of lamotrigine as a maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder in comparison to placebo and lithium based on the evidence presented in the abstract."

    "query": "Title: Ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators for depression in adults with unipolar major depressive disorder\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMany studies have recently been conducted to assess the antidepressant efficacy of glutamate modification in mood disorders. This is an update of a review first published in 2015 focusing on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects ‐ and review the acceptability and tolerability ‐ of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO all years to July 2020.  We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. \nSelection criteria:\nDouble‐ or single‐blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ketamine, memantine, esketamine or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (pill or saline infusion), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. \nData collection and analysis:\nThree review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were response rate (50% reduction on a standardised rating scale) and adverse events. We decided a priori to measure the efficacy outcomes at different time points and run sensitivity/subgroup analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. \nMain results:\nThirty‐one new studies were identified for inclusion in this updated review. Overall, we included 64 studies (5299 participants) on ketamine (31 trials), esketamine (9), memantine (5), lanicemine (4), D‐cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), riluzole (2), atomoxetine (1), basimglurant (1), citicoline (1), CP‐101,606 (1), decoglurant (1), MK‐0657 (1), N‐acetylcysteine (1), rapastinel (1), and sarcosine (1). Forty‐eight studies were placebo‐controlled, and 48 were two‐arm studies. The majority of trials defined an inclusion criterion for the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline: 29 at least moderate depression; 17 severe depression; and five mild‐to‐moderate depression. Nineteen studies recruited only patients with treatment‐resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to at least two antidepressants. The majority of studies investigating ketamine administered as a single dose, whilst all of the included esketamine studies used a multiple dose regimen (most frequently twice a week for four weeks). Most studies looking at ketamine used intravenous administration, whilst the majority of esketamine trials used intranasal routes. The evidence suggests that ketamine may result in an increase in response and remission compared with placebo at 24 hours odds ratio (OR) 3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54 to 10.10; n = 185, studies = 7, very low‐certainty evidence). Ketamine may reduce depression rating scale scores over placebo at 24 hours, but the evidence is very uncertain (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.87, 95% CI ‐1.26 to ‐0.48; n = 231, studies = 8, very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants assigned to ketamine or placebo who dropped out for any reason (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.28; n = 201, studies = 6, very low‐certainty evidence). When compared with midazolam, the evidence showed that ketamine increases remission rates at 24 hours (OR 2.21, 95% CI 0.67 to 7.32; n = 122,studies = 2, low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the response efficacy of ketamine at 24 hours in comparison with midazolam, and its ability to reduce depression rating scale scores at the same time point (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.00 to 6.18; n = 296, studies = 4,very low‐certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who dropped out of studies for any reason between ketamine and midazolam (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.09; n = 72, studies = 1, low‐certainty evidence). Esketamine treatment likely results in a large increase in participants achieving remission at 24 hours compared with placebo (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.40; n = 894, studies = 5, moderate‐certainty evidence). Esketamine probably results in decreases in depression rating scale scores at 24 hours compared with placebo (SMD ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.45 to ‐0.17; n = 824, studies = 4, moderate‐certainty evidence). Our findings show that esketamine increased response rates, although this evidence is uncertain (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.68; n = 1071, studies = 5, low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence that participants assigned to esketamine treatment dropped out of trials more frequently than those assigned to placebo for any reason (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.73; n = 773, studies = 4,moderate‐certainty evidence). We found very little evidence for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators. We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOur findings show that ketamine and esketamine may be more efficacious than placebo at 24 hours. How these findings translate into clinical practice, however, is not entirely clear. The evidence for use of the remaining glutamate receptor modulators is limited as very few trials were included in the meta‐analyses for each comparison and the majority of comparisons included only one study. Long term non‐inferiority RCTs comparing repeated ketamine and esketamine, and rigorous real‐world monitoring are needed to establish comprehensive data on safety and efficacy.",
    "reference_answer": "Given the main findings of the abstract on ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators for depression, here is a set of scoring reference points based on the study's conclusions:\n\n- **Response Rate to Ketamine at 24 Hours (Compared with Placebo)**\n  - Positive Response (50% reduction): Odds Ratio (OR) 3.94\n  - Very Low-Certainty Evidence: Evaluate with caution due to evidence uncertainty.\n  \n- **Reduction in Depression Rating Scale Scores (Ketamine vs. Placebo) at 24 Hours**\n  - Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) of -0.87.\n  - Very Low-Certainty Evidence: Score with acknowledgment of uncertainty in efficacy.\n\n- **Remission Rates with Ketamine at 24 Hours (Compared with Midazolam)**\n  - Remission Increase: OR 2.21\n  - Low-Certainty Evidence: Consider the low reliability of remission results.\n\n- **Depression Rating Scale Score Reduction (Ketamine vs. Midazolam) at 24 Hours**\n  - Uncertain Evidence: SMD data unavailable, OR 2.48 for efficacy response.\n  - Very Low-Certainty Evidence: Score based on speculative efficacy findings.\n\n- **Response and Remission Rates with Esketamine vs. Placebo at 24 Hours**\n  - Remission Improvement: OR 2.74\n  - Moderate-Certainty Evidence: Score highly due to moderate confidence in evidence.\n\n- **Decrease in Depression Rating Scale Scores (Esketamine vs. Placebo) at 24 Hours**\n  - SMD of -0.31\n  - Moderate-Certainty Evidence: Score moderately, recognizing strong evidence support.\n\n- **Response Rate Increase with Esketamine (vs. Placebo)**\n  - Increased Response: OR 2.11\n  - Low-Certainty Evidence: Score with consideration of lower evidence reliability.\n\n- **Dropout Rates Across All Treatments (Ketamine and Esketamine vs. Placebo)**\n  - No Significant Difference: Ketamine OR 1.25, Esketamine OR 1.58\n  - Consider evidence certainty and potential biases in trial designs.\n\n- **General Bias and Certainty Assessment**\n  - Low or Unclear Risk of Bias: Enhanced confidence in results' reliability.\n  - Acknowledge limitations due to unclear treatment masking.\n\n- **Long-term Non-inferiority and Safety Monitoring Recommendation**\n  - Emphasis on requirement for robust, long-term RCTs for prolonged efficacy and safety.\n  - High importance placed on real-world data for clinical application relevance.\n\nScoring should reflect these evidence-based points, weighting findings with explicit regard to their certainty and detailed contextual notes from the abstract."

    "query": "Title: Behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAutistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is an increasingly recognised neurodevelopmental condition; that is, a neurologically‐based condition which interferes with the acquisition, retention or application of specific skills. ASD is characterised by challenges with socialisation and communication, and by stereotyped and repetitive behaviours. A stereotyped behaviour is one which is repeated over and over again and which seems not to have any useful function. ASD often co‐occurs with mental health disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). People with ASD may show certain cognitive differences (i.e. differences in ways of thinking) which influence their response to therapies. Thus, there is a need for evidence‐based guidelines to treat mental health issues in this group. OCD, a common condition characterised by repeated obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts, occurs with greater frequency in persons with ASD than in the general population. Genetic, anatomic, neurobiological and psychological factors have been proposed to explain this co‐occurrence. However, care should be taken to distinguish stereotyped and repetitive behaviours characteristic of ASD from obsessive compulsive acts in OCD. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended treatment for OCD, but studies have suggested that this treatment may be less effective in those with OCD co‐occurring with ASD. Hence, modifications to CBT treatment may be helpful when treating OCD co‐occurring with ASD to optimise outcomes. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). \nSearch methods:\nWe searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other bibliographic databases, international trial registries and other sources of grey literature (to 24 August 2020). We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches. We contacted subject experts for further information when needed. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross‐over, cluster‐ and quasi‐randomised controlled trials involving both adults and children with diagnoses of OCD and ASD. We included studies of participants with co‐occurring conditions (i.e. those experiencing other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental conditions at the same time), but we did not include individuals who had a co‐occurring global learning difficulty. Treatment could be in any setting or format and include behavioural therapy (BT) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which may have been adapted for those with ASD. Comparator interventions included no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo (where the control group receives non‐specific aspects of therapy, but not the active ingredient) and treatment as usual (TAU, where the control group receives the usual treatment, according to accepted standards). \nData collection and analysis:\nThree review authors independently screened studies for inclusion. The authors extracted relevant data from the one eligible study, assessed the risk of bias and certainty of evidence (GRADE). Outcomes of interest were changes in OCD symptoms and treatment completion (primary outcome), and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and behavioural difficulties, as well as degree of family accommodation (secondary outcomes). We did not conduct meta‐analyses as only one study met the selection criteria. \nMain results:\nWe included only one RCT of 46 participants in our analysis. This study compared CBT for OCD in persons with high‐functioning ASD with a control group who received anxiety management only. There were no differences in rates of treatment completion between the CBT (87%) and anxiety management (87%) groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.25; low‐certainty evidence). Behavioural difficulties were not included as an outcome measure in the study. This study showed that there may be a benefit at the end of treatment favouring CBT compared with anxiety management in OCD symptoms (mean difference (MD) ‐3.00, 95% CI ‐8.02 to 2.02), depression symptoms (MD ‐1.80, 95% CI ‐11.50 to 7.90), anxiety symptoms (MD ‐3.20, 95% CI ‐11.38 to 4.98), and quality of life (MD 5.20, 95% CI ‐1.41 to 11.81), but the evidence was of low certainty.  \nAuthors' conclusions:\nEvidence is limited regarding the efficacy of CBT for treatment of OCD in ASD. There is much scope for future study, not only examining the efficacy of CBT for OCD in ASD, but also the particular ways that OCD manifests in and affects people with ASD and the role of the family in treatment response.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Treatment Completion Rates:**\n  - Criterion for scoring: Assess whether there are differences in treatment completion rates between the CBT group and the anxiety management group.\n  - Full score: No significant differences in treatment completion rates (87% completion in both groups).\n\n- **Reduction in OCD Symptoms:**\n  - Criterion for scoring: Evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in reducing OCD symptoms compared to the control group.\n  - Full score: Potential benefits shown in reducing OCD symptoms with a mean difference, though based on low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Reduction in Depressive Symptoms:**\n  - Criterion for scoring: Measure the impact of CBT on depressive symptoms compared to the anxiety management group.\n  - Full score: Potential benefits observed in reducing depressive symptoms, but with low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Reduction in Anxiety Symptoms:**\n  - Criterion for scoring: Assess the effectiveness of CBT in reducing anxiety symptoms compared to the control group.\n  - Full score: Indication of benefit in reducing anxiety symptoms, but results are based on low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Improvement in Quality of Life:**\n  - Criterion for scoring: Determine the impact of CBT on improving quality of life in participants compared to anxiety management.\n  - Full score: Evidence suggests an improvement in quality of life, but the certainty of evidence is low.\n\n- **Certainty of Evidence:**\n  - Criterion for scoring: Consider the certainty of evidence supporting the findings (i.e., high, moderate, low, or very low).\n  - Full score: Acknowledge that all potential benefits noted (OCD symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life) are based on low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Scope for Future Research:**\n  - Criterion for scoring: Recognize the need for further studies examining CBT efficacy for OCD in ASD populations.\n  - Full score: Highlighted potential for further research due to limited evidence and low certainty of current findings."

    "query": "Title: Enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nThe balance of benefits and harms associated with enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia is not clear. An increasing number of guidelines highlight the lack of evidenced benefit and potential risks of enteral tube feeding. In some areas of the world, the use of enteral tube feeding is decreasing, and in other areas it is increasing. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia who develop problems with eating and swallowing or who have reduced food and fluid intake. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registers on 14 April 2021. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled non‐randomised studies. Our population of interest was adults of any age with a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia of any cause, with severe cognitive and functional impairment, and poor nutritional intake. Eligible studies evaluated the effectiveness and complications of enteral tube feeding via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, or via jejunal post‐pyloric feeding, in comparison with standard care or enhanced standard care, such as an intervention to promote oral intake. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. \nData collection and analysis:\nThree review authors screened citations and two review authors assessed full texts of potentially eligible studies against inclusion criteria. One review author extracted data, which were then checked independently by a second review author. We used the 'Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomised Studies of Interventions' (ROBINS‐I) tool to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Risk of confounding was assessed against a pre‐agreed list of key potential confounding variables. Our primary outcomes were survival time, quality of life, and pressure ulcers. Results were not suitable for meta‐analysis, so we presented them narratively. We presented results separately for studies of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding, nasogastric tube feeding and studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall certainty of the evidence related to each outcome for each study. \nMain results:\nWe found no eligible RCTs. We included fourteen controlled, non‐randomised studies. All the included studies compared outcomes between groups of people who had been assigned to enteral tube feeding or oral feeding by prior decision of a healthcare professional. Some studies controlled for a range of confounding factors, but there were high or very high risks of bias due to confounding in all studies, and high or critical risks of selection bias in some studies. Four studies with 36,816 participants assessed the effect of PEG feeding on survival time. None found any evidence of effects on survival time (low‐certainty evidence). Three of four studies using mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding methods in 310 participants (227 enteral tube feeding, 83 no enteral tube feeding) found them to be associated with longer survival time. The fourth study (1386 participants: 135 enteral tube feeding, 1251 no enteral tube feeding) found no evidence of an effect. The certainty of this body of evidence is very low. One study of PEG feeding (4421 participants: 1585 PEG, 2836 no enteral tube feeding) found PEG feeding increased the risk of pressure ulcers (moderate‐certainty evidence). Two of three studies reported an increase in the number of pressure ulcers in those receiving mixed or unspecified enteral tube feeding (234 participants: 88 enteral tube feeding, 146 no enteral tube feeding). The third study found no effect (very‐low certainty evidence).  Two studies of nasogastric tube feeding did not report data on survival time or pressure ulcers. None of the included studies assessed quality of life. Only one study, using mixed methods of enteral tube feeding, reported on pain and comfort, finding no difference between groups. In the same study, a higher proportion of carers reported very heavy burden in the enteral tube feeding group compared to no enteral tube feeding. Two studies assessed the effect of nasogastric tube feeding on mortality (236 participants: 144 nasogastric group, 92 no enteral tube feeding). One study of 67 participants (14 nasogastric, 53 no enteral tube feeding) found nasogastric feeding was associated with increased mortality risk. The second study found no difference in mortality between groups. The certainty of this evidence is very low. Results on mortality for those using PEG or mixed methods of enteral tube feeding were mixed and the certainty of evidence was very low. There was some evidence from two studies for enteral tube feeding improving nutritional parameters, but this was very low‐certainty evidence. Five studies reported a variety of harm‐related outcomes with inconsistent results. The balance of evidence suggested increased risk of pneumonia with enteral tube feeding. None of the included studies assessed behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found no evidence that tube feeding improves survival; improves quality of life; reduces pain; reduces mortality; decreases behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; leads to better nourishment; improves family or carer outcomes such as depression, anxiety, carer burden, or satisfaction with care; and no indication of harm. We found some evidence that there is a clinically significant risk of pressure ulcers from enteral tube feeding. Future research should focus on better reporting and matching of control and intervention groups, and clearly defined interventions, measuring all the outcomes referred to here.",
    "reference_answer": "The main findings of the study on enteral tube feeding for people with severe dementia can be distilled into scoring reference points that succinctly evaluate each criterion. Here is a structured list of these points:\n\n- **Effect on Survival Time**:\n  - Tool Used: Comparison of PEG feeding vs. oral feeding.\n  - Criterion: No significant evidence to support an effect on survival time.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Low to very low certainty.\n\n- **Risk of Pressure Ulcers**:\n  - Tool Used: Assessment of PEG feeding outcomes.\n  - Criterion: Evidence suggests increased risk of pressure ulcers with enteral tube feeding.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Moderate-certainty for PEG; very low for mixed or unspecified methods.\n\n- **Impact on Mortality**:\n  - Tool Used: Comparison of nasogastric tube feeding vs. no tube feeding.\n  - Criterion: Mixed results; some evidence associating increased mortality with nasogastric tube feeding.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Very low certainty.\n\n- **Quality of Life**:\n  - Tool Used: General assessment across studies.\n  - Criterion: No data to suggest improvements in quality of life from enteral tube feeding.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Not assessed.\n\n- **Pain and Comfort**:\n  - Tool Used: Evaluation of pain and comfort levels.\n  - Criterion: No significant differences reported between enteral and non-enteral feeding groups.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Very low certainty.\n\n- **Carer Burden**:\n  - Tool Used: Carer feedback on burden.\n  - Criterion: Higher burden associated with enteral tube feeding according to carers.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Very low certainty.\n\n- **Nutritional Parameters**:\n  - Tool Used: Studies on nutritional outcomes.\n  - Criterion: Possible improvement, but evidence lacks certainty and consistency.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Very low certainty.\n\n- **Risk of Pneumonia**:\n  - Tool Used: Harm-related outcome assessment.\n  - Criterion: Suggestive evidence of increased pneumonia risk with enteral tube feeding.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Not specifically rated, part of general harm assessment.\n\n- **Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia**:\n  - Tool Used: No specific studies or assessments.\n  - Criterion: Not assessed in included studies.\n\n- **General Harm and Safety**:\n  - Tool Used: Variety of harm-related outcomes.\n  - Criterion: Inconsistent results, with a balance suggesting risk rather than benefit.\n  - Evidence Certainty: Not consistently reported.\n\nThese reference points serve as a comprehensive evaluation framework based on the main findings of the study on enteral tube feeding for severe dementia patients, highlighting key areas for future research improvement."

PWs included: primary health professionals (PHPs), lay health workers (LHWs), community non‐health professionals (CPs).  \nData collection and analysis:\nSeven conditions were identified apriori and analysed by disorder and PW examining recovery, prevalence, symptom change, quality‐of‐life (QOL), functioning, service use (SU), and adverse events (AEs).  Risk ratios (RRs) were used for dichotomous outcomes; mean difference (MDs), standardised mean differences (SMDs), or mean change differences (MCDs) for continuous outcomes.  For SMDs, 0.20 to 0.49 represented small, 0.50 to 0.79 moderate, and ≥0.80 large clinical effects.

    "query": "Title: Magnetic seizure therapy for treatment‐resistant depression\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMagnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a potential alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Reports to date on use of MST for patients with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) are limited. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effects of MST in comparison with sham‐MST, antidepressant, and other forms of electric or magnetic treatment for adults with TRD. \nSearch methods:\nIn March 2020, we searched a wide range of international electronic sources for published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews and conference proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP), the Annual Scientific Convention and Meeting, and the Annual Meeting of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) to identify additional studies. \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised clinical trials (RCTs) focused on MST for adults with TRD. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we estimated mean differences (MDs) between groups and 95% CIs. We employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. Our main outcomes of interest were symptom severity, cognitive function, suicide, quality of life, social functioning, dropout for any reason, serious adverse events, and adverse events that led to discontinuation of treatment. \nMain results:\nWe included three studies (65 participants) comparing MST with ECT. Two studies reported depressive symptoms with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). However, in one study, the data were skewed and there was an imbalance in baseline characteristics. Analysis of these two studies showed no clear differences in depressive symptoms between treatment groups (MD 0.71, 95% CI ‐2.23 to 3.65; 2 studies, 40 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies investigated multiple domains of cognitive function. However most of the outcomes were not measured by validated neuropsychological tests, and many of the data suffered from unbalanced baseline and skewed distribution. Analysis of immediate memory performance measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale showed no clear differences between treatment groups (MD 0.40, 95% CI ‐4.16 to 4.96; 1 study, 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Analysis of delayed memory performance measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale also showed no clear differences between treatment groups (MD 2.57, 95% CI ‐2.39 to 7.53; 1 study, 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported quality of life, but the data were skewed and baseline data were unbalanced across groups. Analysis of quality of life showed no clear differences between treatment groups (MD 14.86, 95% CI ‐42.26 to 71.98; 1 study, 20 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported dropout and adverse events that led to discontinuation of treatment. Analysis of reported data showed no clear differences between treatment groups for this outcome (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 6.91; 1 study, 25 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events occurred in only two participants who received ECT (worsening of preexisting coronary heart disease and a cognitive adverse effect). None of the included studies reported outcomes on suicide and social functioning. No RCTs comparing MST with other treatments were identified. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nEvidence regarding effects of MST on patients with TRD is currently insufficient. Our analyses of available data did not reveal clearly different effects between MST and ECT. We are uncertain about these findings because of risk of bias and imprecision of estimates. Large, long, well‐designed, and well‐reported trials are needed to further examine the effects of MST.",

    "query": "Title: Training healthcare providers to respond to intimate partner violence against women\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nIntimate partner violence (IPV) includes any violence (physical, sexual or psychological/emotional) by a current or former partner. This review reflects the current understanding of IPV as a profoundly gendered issue, perpetrated most often by men against women. IPV may result in substantial physical and mental health impacts for survivors. Women affected by IPV are more likely to have contact with healthcare providers (HCPs) (e.g. nurses, doctors, midwives), even though women often do not disclose the violence. Training HCPs on IPV, including how to respond to survivors of IPV, is an important intervention to improve HCPs' knowledge, attitudes and practice, and subsequently the care and health outcomes for IPV survivors. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness of training programmes that seek to improve HCPs' identification of and response to IPV against women, compared to no intervention, wait‐list, placebo or training as usual. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and seven other databases up to June 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registries and relevant websites. In addition, we contacted primary authors of included studies to ask if they knew of any relevant studies not identified in the search. We evaluated the reference lists of all included studies and systematic reviews for inclusion. We applied no restrictions by search dates or language. \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing IPV training or educational programmes for HCPs compared with no training, wait‐list, training as usual, placebo, or a sub‐component of the intervention. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures outlined by Cochrane. Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, undertook data extraction and assessed risks of bias. Where possible, we synthesised the effects of IPV training in a meta‐analysis. Other analyses were synthesised in a narrative manner. We assessed evidence certainty using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included 19 trials involving 1662 participants. Three‐quarters of all studies were conducted in the USA, with single studies from Australia, Iran, Mexico, Turkey and the Netherlands. Twelve trials compared IPV training versus no training, and seven trials compared the effects of IPV training to training as usual or a sub‐component of the intervention in the comparison group, or both. Study participants included 618 medical staff/students, 460 nurses/students, 348 dentists/students, 161 counsellors or psychologists/students, 70 midwives and 5 social workers. Studies were heterogeneous and varied across training content delivered, pedagogy and time to follow‐up (immediately post training to 24 months). The risk of bias assessment highlighted unclear reporting across many areas of bias. The GRADE assessment of the studies found that the certainty of the evidence for the primary outcomes was low to very low, with studies often reporting on perceived or self‐reported outcomes rather than actual HCPs' practices or outcomes for women. Eleven of the 19 included studies received some form of research grant funding to complete the research. Within 12 months post‐intervention, the evidence suggests that compared to no intervention, wait‐list or placebo, IPV training: · may improve HCPs' attitudes towards IPV survivors (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.03; 8 studies, 641 participants; low‐certainty evidence); · may have a large effect on HCPs' self‐perceived readiness to respond to IPV survivors, although the evidence was uncertain (SMD 2.44, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.37; 6 studies, 487 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); · may have a large effect on HCPs' knowledge of IPV, although the evidence was uncertain (SMD 6.56, 95% CI 2.49 to 10.63; 3 studies, 239 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); · may make little to no difference to HCPs' referral practices of women to support agencies, although this is based on only one study (with 49 clinics) assessed to be very low certainty; · has an uncertain effect on HCPs' response behaviours (based on two studies of very low certainty), with one trial (with 27 participants) reporting that trained HCPs were more likely to successfully provide advice on safety planning during their interactions with standardised patients, and the other study (with 49 clinics) reporting no clear impact on safety planning practices; · may improve identification of IPV at six months post‐training (RR 4.54, 95% CI 2.5 to 8.09) as in one study (with 54 participants), although three studies (with 48 participants) reported little to no effects of training on identification or documentation of IPV, or both. No studies assessed the impact of training HCPs on the mental health of women survivors of IPV compared to no intervention, wait‐list or placebo. When IPV training was compared to training as usual or a sub‐component of the intervention, or both, no clear effects were seen on HCPs' attitudes/beliefs, safety planning, and referral to services or mental health outcomes for women. Inconsistent results were seen for HCPs' readiness to respond (improvements in two out of three studies) and HCPs' IPV knowledge (improved in two out of four studies). One study found that IPV training improved HCPs' validation responses. No adverse IPV‐related events were reported in any of the studies identified in this review. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOverall, IPV training for HCPs may be effective for outcomes that are precursors to behaviour change. There is some, albeit weak evidence that IPV training may improve HCPs' attitudes towards IPV. Training may also improve IPV knowledge and HCPs' self‐perceived readiness to respond to those affected by IPV, although we are not certain about this evidence. Although supportive evidence is weak and inconsistent, training may improve HCPs' actual responses, including the use of safety planning, identification and documentation of IPV in women's case histories. The sustained effect of training on these outcomes beyond 12 months is undetermined. Our confidence in these findings is reduced by the substantial level of heterogeneity across studies and the unclear risk of bias around randomisation and blinding of participants, as well as high risk of bias from attrition in many studies. Further research is needed that overcomes these limitations, as well as assesses the impacts of IPV training on HCPs' behavioral outcomes and the well‐being of women survivors of IPV.",

    "query": "Title: New generation antidepressants for depression in children and adolescents: a network meta‐analysis\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMajor depressive disorders have a significant impact on children and adolescents, including on educational and vocational outcomes, interpersonal relationships, and physical and mental health and well‐being. There is an association between major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. Antidepressant medication is used in moderate to severe depression; there is now a range of newer generations of these medications. \nObjectives:\nTo investigate, via network meta‐analysis (NMA), the comparative effectiveness and safety of different newer generation antidepressants in children and adolescents with a diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) in terms of depression, functioning, suicide‐related outcomes and other adverse outcomes. The impact of age, treatment duration, baseline severity, and pharmaceutical industry funding was investigated on clinician‐rated depression (CDRS‐R) and suicide‐related outcomes. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR)), together with Ovid Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO till March 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomised trials of six to 18 year olds of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder were included. Trials that compared the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants with each other or with a placebo were included. Newer generation antidepressants included: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors; norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs); and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data as Odds Ratios (ORs), and continuous data as Mean Difference (MD) for the following outcomes: depression symptom severity (clinician rated), response or remission of depression symptoms, depression symptom severity (self‐rated), functioning, suicide related outcomes and overall adverse outcomes. Random‐effects network meta‐analyses were conducted in a frequentist framework using multivariate meta‐analysis. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Confidence in Network Meta‐analysis (CINeMA). We used \"informative statements\" to standardise the interpretation and description of the results. \nMain results:\nTwenty‐six studies were included. There were no data for the two primary outcomes (depressive disorder established via clinical diagnostic interview and suicide), therefore, the results comprise only secondary outcomes. Most antidepressants may be associated with a \"small and unimportant\" reduction in depression symptoms on the CDRS‐R scale (range 17 to 113) compared with placebo (high certainty evidence: paroxetine: MD ‐1.43, 95% CI ‐3.90, 1.04; vilazodone: MD ‐0.84, 95% CI ‐3.03, 1.35; desvenlafaxine MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐3.51, 3.36; moderate certainty evidence: sertraline: MD ‐3.51, 95% CI ‐6.99, ‐0.04; fluoxetine: MD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐4.12, ‐1.56; escitalopram: MD ‐2.62, 95% CI ‐5.29, 0.04; low certainty evidence: duloxetine: MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐5.03, ‐0.37; vortioxetine: MD 0.60, 95% CI ‐2.52, 3.72; very low certainty evidence for comparisons between other antidepressants and placebo). There were \"small and unimportant\" differences between most antidepressants in reduction of depression symptoms (high‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence). Results were similar across other outcomes of benefit. In most studies risk of self‐harm or suicide was an exclusion criterion for the study. Proportions of suicide‐related outcomes were low for most included studies and 95% confidence intervals were wide for all comparisons. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of mirtazapine (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.03, 8.04), duloxetine (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.72, 1.82), vilazodone (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.68, 1.48), desvenlafaxine (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59, 1.52), citalopram (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.76, 3.87) or vortioxetine (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.29, 8.60) on suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. There is low certainty evidence that escitalopram may \"at least slightly\" reduce odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.43, 1.84). There is low certainty evidence that fluoxetine (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.87, 1.86), paroxetine (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.85, 3.86), sertraline (OR 3.03, 95% CI 0.60, 15.22), and venlafaxine (OR 13.84, 95% CI 1.79, 106.90) may \"at least slightly\" increase odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with placebo. There is moderate certainty evidence that venlafaxine probably results in an \"at least slightly\" increased odds of suicide‐related outcomes compared with desvenlafaxine (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56) and escitalopram (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01, 0.56). There was very low certainty evidence regarding other comparisons between antidepressants. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOverall, methodological shortcomings of the randomised trials make it difficult to interpret the findings with regard to the efficacy and safety of newer antidepressant medications. Findings suggest that most newer antidepressants may reduce depression symptoms in a small and unimportant way compared with placebo. Furthermore, there are likely to be small and unimportant differences in the reduction of depression symptoms between the majority of antidepressants. However, our findings reflect the average effects of the antidepressants, and given depression is a heterogeneous condition, some individuals may experience a greater response. Guideline developers and others making recommendations might therefore consider whether a recommendation for the use of newer generation antidepressants is warranted for some individuals in some circumstances. Our findings suggest sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, as well as fluoxetine (which is currently the only treatment recommended for first‐line prescribing) could be considered as a first option. Children and adolescents considered at risk of suicide were frequently excluded from trials, so that we cannot be confident about the effects of these medications for these individuals. If an antidepressant is being considered for an individual, this should be done in consultation with the child/adolescent and their family/caregivers and it remains critical to ensure close monitoring of treatment effects and suicide‐related outcomes (combined suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) in those treated with newer generation antidepressants, given findings that some of these medications may be associated with greater odds of these events. Consideration of psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy, as per guideline recommendations, remains important.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the abstract and full-score findings, the complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings of the study on new generation antidepressants in children and adolescents would be:\n\n- **Depression Symptom Reduction**:\n  - Most newer antidepressants are associated with a \"small and unimportant\" reduction in depression symptoms compared with placebo.\n  - High certainty: Paroxetine, Vilazodone, Desvenlafaxine.\n  - Moderate certainty: Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Escitalopram.\n  - Low certainty: Duloxetine, Vortioxetine.\n  - Very low certainty for other antidepressants.\n\n- **Difference Between Antidepressants**:\n  - Differences in depression symptom reduction between most antidepressants are small and unimportant.\n  - High to moderate certainty evidence for these comparisons.\n\n- **Suicide-related Outcomes**:\n  - Low certainty evidence for the effect of Mirtazapine, Duloxetine, Vilazodone, Desvenlafaxine, Citalopram, and Vortioxetine on suicide-related outcomes compared to placebo.\n  - Escitalopram may slightly reduce odds of suicide-related outcomes compared with placebo.\n  - Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline, and Venlafaxine may slightly increase odds of suicide-related outcomes compared with placebo.\n  - Moderate certainty evidence that Venlafaxine may result in increased odds of suicide-related outcomes compared to Desvenlafaxine and Escitalopram.\n\n- **Considerations for Clinical Recommendations**:\n  - Guideline developers should consider the small differences in efficacy between antidepressants in recommending newer generation antidepressants for certain individuals.\n  - Sertraline, Escitalopram, Duloxetine, and Fluoxetine may be considered as first-option treatments.\n  - Children and adolescents at risk of suicide were frequently excluded from trials, leading to uncertainty regarding treatment effects for these individuals.\n  - Close monitoring of treatment effects and suicide-related outcomes is critical when prescribing newer generation antidepressants.\n  - Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, should be considered alongside medication, following guideline recommendations."

    "query": "Title: Pharmacological treatment of hypertension in people without prior cerebrovascular disease for the prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nThis is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006 (McGuinness 2006), and previously updated in 2009 (McGuinness 2009). Hypertension is a risk factor for dementia. Observational studies suggest antihypertensive treatment is associated with lower incidences of cognitive impairment and dementia. There is already clear evidence to support the treatment of hypertension after stroke. \nObjectives:\nTo assess whether pharmacological treatment of hypertension can prevent cognitive impairment or dementia in people who have no history of cerebrovascular disease. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, as well as many trials registries and grey literature sources, most recently on 7 July 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which pharmacological interventions to treat hypertension were given for at least 12 months. We excluded trials of pharmacological interventions to lower blood pressure in non‐hypertensive participants. We also excluded trials conducted solely in people with stroke. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected information regarding incidence of dementia, cognitive decline, change in blood pressure, adverse effects and quality of life. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. \nMain results:\nWe included 12 studies, totaling 30,412 participants, in this review. Eight studies compared active treatment with placebo. Of the four non‐placebo‐controlled studies, two compared intensive versus standard blood pressure reduction. The two final included studies compared different classes of antihypertensive drug. Study durations varied from one to five years. The combined result of four placebo‐controlled trials that reported incident dementia indicated no evidence of a difference in the risk of dementia between the antihypertensive treatment group and the placebo group (236/7767 versus 259/7660, odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.09; very low certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations and indirectness). The combined results from five placebo‐controlled trials that reported change in Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) may indicate a modest benefit from antihypertensive treatment (mean difference (MD) 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.29; very low certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations, indirectness and imprecision). The certainty of evidence for both cognitive outcomes was downgraded on the basis of study limitations and indirectness. Study durations were too short, overall, to expect a significant difference in dementia rates between groups. Dementia and cognitive decline were secondary outcomes for most studies. Additional sources of bias include: the use of antihypertensive medication by the placebo group in the placebo‐controlled trials; failure to reach recruitment targets; and early termination of studies on safety grounds. Meta‐analysis of the placebo‐controlled trials reporting results found a mean change in systolic blood pressure of ‐9.25 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.73, ‐8.78) between treatment (n = 8973) and placebo (n = 8820) groups, and a mean change in diastolic blood pressure of ‐2.47 mmHg (95% CI ‐2.70, ‐2.24) between treatment (n = 7700) and placebo (n = 7509) groups (both low certainty evidence downgraded on the basis of study limitations and inconsistency). Three trials ‐ SHEP 1991, LOMIR MCT IL 1996 and MRC 1996 ‐ reported more withdrawals due to adverse events in active treatment groups than placebo groups. Participants on active treatment in Syst Eur 1998 were less likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects, and participants on active treatment in HYVET 2008 reported fewer 'serious adverse events' than in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference in withdrawals rates between groups in SCOPE 2003, and results were unclear for Perez Stable 2000 and Zhang 2018. Heterogeneity precluded meta‐analysis. Five of the placebo‐controlled trials provided quality of life (QOL) data. Heterogeneity again precluded meta‐analysis. SHEP 1991, Syst Eur 1998 and HYVET 2008 reported no evidence of a difference in QOL measures between active treatment and placebo groups over time. The SCOPE 2003 sub‐study (Degl'Innocenti 2004) showed a smaller drop in QOL measures in the active treatment compared to the placebo group. LOMIR MCT IL 1996 reported an improvement in a QOL measure at twelve months in one active treatment group and deterioration in another. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nHigh certainty randomised controlled trial evidence regarding the effect of hypertension treatment on dementia and cognitive decline does not yet exist. The studies included in this review provide low certainty evidence (downgraded primarily due to study limitations and indirectness) that pharmacological treatment of hypertension, in people without prior cerebrovascular disease, leads to less cognitive decline compared to controls. This difference is below the level considered clinically significant. The studies included in this review also provide very low certainty evidence that pharmacological treatment of hypertension, in people without prior cerebrovascular disease, prevents dementia.",

    "query": "Title: Internet‐based cognitive and behavioural therapies for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nTherapist‐delivered trauma‐focused psychological therapies are effective for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and have become the accepted first‐line treatments. Despite the established evidence‐base for these therapies, they are not always widely available or accessible. Many barriers limit treatment uptake, such as the number of qualified therapists available to deliver the interventions; cost; and compliance issues, such as time off work, childcare, and transportation, associated with the need to attend weekly appointments. Delivering Internet‐based cognitive and behavioural therapy (I‐C/BT) is an effective and acceptable alternative to therapist‐delivered treatments for anxiety and depression. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of I‐C/BT for PTSD in adults. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to June 2020. We also searched online clinical trial registries and reference lists of included studies and contacted the authors of included studies and other researchers in the field to identify additional and ongoing studies. \nSelection criteria:\nWe searched for RCTs of I‐C/BT compared to face‐to‐face or Internet‐based psychological treatment, psychoeducation, wait list, or care as usual. We included studies of adults (aged over 16 years), in which at least 70% of the participants met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently assessed abstracts, extracted data, and entered data into Review Manager 5. The primary outcomes were severity of PTSD symptoms and dropouts. Secondary outcomes included diagnosis of PTSD after treatment, severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, cost‐effectiveness, adverse events, treatment acceptability, and quality of life. We analysed categorical outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We pooled data using a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis, except where heterogeneity was present, in which case we used a random‐effects model. We independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias and we evaluated the certainty of available evidence using the GRADE approach; we discussed any conflicts with at least one other review author, with the aim of reaching a unanimous decision. \nMain results:\nWe included 13 studies with 808 participants. Ten studies compared I‐C/BT delivered with therapist guidance to a wait list control. Two studies compared guided I‐C/BT with I‐non‐C/BT. One study compared guided I‐C/BT with face‐to‐face non‐C/BT. There was substantial heterogeneity among the included studies. I‐C/BT compared with face‐to‐face non‐CBT Very low‐certainty evidence based on one small study suggested face‐to‐face non‐CBT may be more effective than I‐C/BT at reducing PTSD symptoms post‐treatment (MD 10.90, 95% CI 6.57 to 15.23; studies = 1, participants = 40). There may be no evidence of a difference in dropout rates between treatments (RR 2.49, 95% CI 0.91 to 6.77; studies = 1, participants = 40; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure diagnosis of PTSD, severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms, cost‐effectiveness, or adverse events. I‐C/BT compared with wait list Very low‐certainty evidence showed that, compared with wait list, I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in PTSD post‐treatment (SMD –0.61, 95% CI –0.93 to –0.29; studies = 10, participants = 608). There may be no evidence of a difference in dropout rates between the I‐C/BT and wait list groups (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.60; studies = 9, participants = 634; low‐certainty evidence). I‐C/BT may be no more effective than wait list at reducing the risk of a diagnosis of PTSD after treatment (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.00; studies = 1, participants = 62; very low‐certainty evidence). I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in symptoms of depression post‐treatment (SMD –0.51, 95% CI –0.97 to –0.06; studies = 7, participants = 473; very low‐certainty evidence). Very low‐certainty evidence also suggested that I‐C/BT may be associated with a clinically important reduction in symptoms of anxiety post‐treatment (SMD –0.61, 95% CI –0.89 to –0.33; studies = 5, participants = 345). There were no data regarding cost‐effectiveness. Data regarding adverse events were uncertain, as only one study reported an absence of adverse events. I‐C/BT compared with I‐non‐C/BT There may be no evidence of a difference in PTSD symptoms post‐treatment between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups (SMD –0.08, 95% CI –0.52 to 0.35; studies = 2, participants = 82; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference between dropout rates from the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.97 to 4.73; studies = 2, participants = 132; I² = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies found no evidence of a difference in post‐treatment depressive symptoms between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups (SMD –0.12, 95% CI –0.78 to 0.54; studies = 2, participants = 84; very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies found no evidence of a difference in post‐treatment symptoms of anxiety between the I‐C/BT and I‐non‐C/BT groups (SMD 0.08, 95% CI –0.78 to 0.95; studies = 2, participants = 74; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no data regarding cost‐effectiveness. Data regarding adverse effects were uncertain, as it was not discernible whether adverse effects reported were attributable to the intervention. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWhile the review found some beneficial effects of I‐C/BT for PTSD, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to the small number of included trials. This review update found many planned and ongoing studies, which is encouraging since further work is required to establish non‐inferiority to current first‐line interventions, explore mechanisms of change, establish optimal levels of guidance, explore cost‐effectiveness, measure adverse events, and determine predictors of efficacy and dropout.",

    "query": "Title: Treatment of epilepsy for people with Alzheimer's disease\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAny type of seizure can be observed in Alzheimer's disease. Antiepileptic drugs seem to prevent the recurrence of epileptic seizures in most people with Alzheimer's disease. There are pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatments for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease, however there are no current systematic reviews to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of these treatments. This review aims to investigate these different modalities. This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2018. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological or non‐pharmacological interventions for the treatment of epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease (including sporadic Alzheimer's disease and dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease). \nSearch methods:\nFor the latest update, on 3 August 2020 we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 31 July 2020). CRS Web includes randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials from PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialized Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Cochrane Epilepsy. In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists and relevant conference proceedings; we also contacted trial authors and pharmaceutical companies. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials investigating treatment for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease, with the primary outcomes of proportion of participants with seizure freedom and proportion of participants experiencing adverse events. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, cross‐checked the data for accuracy and assessed the methodological quality. We performed no meta‐analyses due to there being limited available data. \nMain results:\nWe included one randomized controlled trial (RCT) on pharmacological interventions; the trial included 95 participants. No studies were found for non‐pharmacological interventions. Concerning the proportion of participants with seizure freedom, no significant differences were found for the comparisons of levetiracetam versus lamotrigine (RR) 1.20, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.71; 67 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), levetiracetam versus phenobarbital (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.19; 66 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or lamotrigine versus phenobarbital (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.02; 57 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It seemed that levetiracetam could improve cognition and lamotrigine could relieve depression, while phenobarbital and lamotrigine could worsen cognition, and levetiracetam and phenobarbital could worsen mood. The risk of bias relating to allocation, blinding and selective reporting was unclear. We judged the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to be very low. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review does not provide sufficient evidence to support levetiracetam, phenobarbital or lamotrigine for the treatment of epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease. Regarding efficacy and tolerability, no significant differences were found between levetiracetam, phenobarbital and lamotrigine. Large RCTs with a double‐blind, parallel‐group design are required to determine the efficacy and tolerability of treatment for epilepsy in people with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Study Population and Methodology:**\n  - Include only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a total of 95 participants.\n  - Assess pharmacological interventions exclusively; no studies for non-pharmacological interventions were found.\n\n- **Primary Outcome - Seizure Freedom:**\n  - Evaluate the proportion of participants achieving seizure freedom.\n  - No significant differences in seizure freedom observed among the compared drugs:\n    - Levetiracetam versus lamotrigine.\n    - Levetiracetam versus phenobarbital.\n    - Lamotrigine versus phenobarbital.\n\n- **Cognitive and Mood Effects:**\n  - Possible cognitive and mood effects observed, albeit with very low-certainty evidence:\n    - Levetiracetam may improve cognition.\n    - Lamotrigine may relieve depression.\n    - Phenobarbital and lamotrigine may worsen cognition.\n    - Levetiracetam and phenobarbital may exacerbate mood issues.\n\n- **Risk of Bias and Evidence Certainty:**\n  - Identify unclear risk of bias in terms of allocation, blinding, and selective reporting.\n  - Assign very low certainty to the evidence of all outcomes.\n\n- **Conclusions and Recommendations:**\n  - Acknowledge the insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of levetiracetam, phenobarbital, or lamotrigine for treating epilepsy in Alzheimer's patients.\n  - Recommend conducting large, double-blind, parallel-group RCTs to better assess the efficacy and tolerability of the treatments."

    "query": "Title: Psychosocial interventions for self‐harm in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSelf‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most counties, often repeated, and associated with suicide. There has been a substantial increase in both the number of trials and therapeutic approaches of psychosocial interventions for SH in adults. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2016) on the role of psychosocial interventions in the treatment of SH in adults. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for self‐harm (SH) compared to comparison types of care (e.g. treatment‐as‐usual, routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care, active comparator) for adults (aged 18 years or older) who engage in SH. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care (EUC), active comparator, or a combination of these, in the treatment of adults with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratio (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included data from 76 trials with a total of 21,414 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (61.9%) with a mean age of 31.8 years (standard deviation [SD] 11.7 years). On the basis of data from four trials, individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy may reduce repetition of SH as compared to TAU or another comparator by the end of the intervention (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.02; N = 238; k = 4; GRADE: low certainty evidence), although there was imprecision in the effect estimate. At longer follow‐up time points (e.g., 6‐ and 12‐months) there was some evidence that individual CBT‐based psychotherapy may reduce SH repetition. Whilst there may be a slightly lower rate of SH repetition for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) (66.0%) as compared to TAU or alternative psychotherapy (68.2%), the evidence remains uncertain as to whether DBT reduces absolute repetition of SH by the post‐intervention assessment. On the basis of data from a single trial, mentalisation‐based therapy (MBT) reduces repetition of SH and frequency of SH by the post‐intervention assessment (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; N = 134; k = 1; GRADE: high‐certainty evidence). A group‐based emotion‐regulation psychotherapy may also reduce repetition of SH by the post‐intervention assessment based on evidence from two trials by the same author group (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; N = 83; k = 2; moderate‐certainty evidence). There is probably little to no effect for different variants of DBT on absolute repetition of SH, including DBT group‐based skills training, DBT individual skills training, or an experimental form of DBT in which participants were given significantly longer cognitive exposure to stressful events. The evidence remains uncertain as to whether provision of information and support, based on the Suicide Trends in At‐Risk Territories (START) and the SUicide‐PREvention Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal behaviors (SUPRE‐MISS) models, have any effect on repetition of SH by the post‐intervention assessment. There was no evidence of a difference for psychodynamic psychotherapy, case management, general practitioner (GP) management, remote contact interventions, and other multimodal interventions, or a variety of brief emergency department‐based interventions. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOverall, there were significant methodological limitations across the trials included in this review. Given the moderate or very low quality of the available evidence, there is only uncertain evidence regarding a number of psychosocial interventions for adults who engage in SH. Psychosocial therapy based on CBT approaches may result in fewer individuals repeating SH at longer follow‐up time points, although no such effect was found at the post‐intervention assessment and the quality of evidence, according to the GRADE criteria, was low. Given findings in single trials, or trials by the same author group, both MBT and group‐based emotion regulation therapy should be further developed and evaluated in adults. DBT may also lead to a reduction in frequency of SH. Other interventions were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to the use of these interventions is inconclusive at present.",
    "reference_answer": "Bullet points representing essential scoring criteria for the main findings include:\n\n- **Individual CBT-Based Psychotherapy:**\n  - Effectiveness at longer follow-up periods for reducing repetition of self-harm (SH) compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) or other comparators.\n  - Low certainty of evidence regarding the impact at the post-intervention stage.\n\n- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**\n  - Slight reduction in SH repetition compared to TAU or alternative psychotherapies, though absolute effectiveness remains uncertain.\n  - No substantial evidence for impact at the post-intervention assessment in various DBT formats (group-based skills training, individual skills training, or experimental longer cognitive exposure).\n\n- **Mentalisation-Based Therapy (MBT):**\n  - High-certainty evidence from a single trial demonstrating reduction in SH repetition and frequency at the post-intervention assessment.\n\n- **Group-Based Emotion-Regulation Psychotherapy:**\n  - Moderate-certainty evidence from trials by the same author group indicating reduced repetition of SH at the post-intervention stage.\n\n- **Other Interventions:**\n  - No significant effect on SH repetition found for psychodynamic psychotherapy, case management, general practitioner management, remote contact interventions, or other multimodal interventions.\n  - Lack of conclusive evidence based on trials of moderate to very low quality.\n\n- **General Conclusions:**\n  - Significant methodological limitations across trials, promoting uncertainty in evidence quality for many psychosocial interventions.\n  - Need for further research and development for interventions like MBT and group-based emotion regulation therapy due to potential promising outcomes."

    "query": "Title: Approaches for discontinuation versus continuation of long‐term antidepressant use for depressive and anxiety disorders in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDepression and anxiety are the most frequent indication for which antidepressants are prescribed. Long‐term antidepressant use is driving much of the internationally observed rise in antidepressant consumption. Surveys of antidepressant users suggest that 30% to 50% of long‐term antidepressant prescriptions had no evidence‐based indication. Unnecessary use of antidepressants puts people at risk of adverse events. However, high‐certainty evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness and safety of approaches to discontinuing long‐term antidepressants. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of approaches for discontinuation versus continuation of long‐term antidepressant use for depressive and anxiety disorders in adults. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched all databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) until January 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included RCTs comparing approaches to discontinuation with continuation of antidepressants (or usual care) for people with depression or anxiety who are prescribed antidepressants for at least six months. Interventions included discontinuation alone (abrupt or taper), discontinuation with psychological therapy support, and discontinuation with minimal intervention. Primary outcomes were  successful discontinuation rate,   relapse  (as defined by authors of the original study),  withdrawal symptoms,  and  adverse events.  Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, social and occupational functioning, and severity of illness. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane . \nMain results:\nWe included 33 studies involving 4995 participants. Nearly all studies were conducted in a specialist mental healthcare service and included participants with recurrent depression (i.e. two or more episodes of depression prior to discontinuation). All included trials were at high risk of bias. The main limitation of the review is bias due to confounding withdrawal symptoms with symptoms of relapse of depression. Withdrawal symptoms (such as low mood, dizziness) may have an effect on almost every outcome including adverse events, quality of life, social functioning, and severity of illness. Abrupt discontinuation Thirteen studies reported abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that abrupt discontinuation without psychological support may increase  risk of relapse  (hazard ratio (HR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.74; 1373 participants, 10 studies) and there is insufficient evidence of its effect on  adverse events  (odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.99; 1012 participants, 7 studies; I² = 37%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of abrupt discontinuation on  withdrawal symptoms  (1 study) is very uncertain. None of these studies included  successful discontinuation rate  as a primary endpoint. Discontinuation by \"taper\" Eighteen studies examined discontinuation by \"tapering\" (one week or longer). Most tapering regimens lasted four weeks or less. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that \"tapered\" discontinuation may lead to higher  risk of relapse  (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.93; 1546 participants, 13 studies) with no or little difference in  adverse events  (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.38; 1479 participants, 7 studies; I² = 0%) compared to continuation of antidepressants, without specific assessment of withdrawal symptoms. Evidence about the effects of discontinuation on  withdrawal symptoms  (1 study) is very uncertain. Discontinuation with psychological support Four studies reported discontinuation with psychological support. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that initiation of preventive cognitive therapy (PCT), or MBCT, combined with \"tapering\" may result in  successful discontinuation rates  of 40% to 75% in the discontinuation group (690 participants, 3 studies). Data from control groups in these studies were requested but are not yet available. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that discontinuation combined with psychological intervention may result in no or little effect on  relapse  (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.19; 690 participants, 3 studies) compared to continuation of antidepressants.  Withdrawal symptoms  were not measured. Pooling data on  adverse events  was not possible due to insufficient information (3 studies). Discontinuation with minimal intervention Low‐certainty evidence from one study suggests that a letter to the general practitioner (GP) to review antidepressant treatment may result in no or little effect on  successful discontinuation rate  compared to usual care (6% versus 8%; 146 participants, 1 study) or on  relapse  (relapse rate 26% vs 13%; 146 participants, 1 study). No data on  withdrawal symptoms  nor  adverse events  were provided. None of the studies used low‐intensity psychological interventions such as online support or a changed pharmaceutical formulation that allows tapering with low doses over several months. Insufficient data were available for the majority of people taking antidepressants in the community (i.e. those with only one or no prior episode of depression), for people aged 65 years and older, and for people taking antidepressants for anxiety. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nCurrently, relatively few studies have focused on approaches to discontinuation of long‐term antidepressants. We cannot make any firm conclusions about effects and safety of the approaches studied to date. The true effect and safety are likely to be substantially different from the data presented due to assessment of relapse of depression that is confounded by withdrawal symptoms. All other outcomes are confounded with withdrawal symptoms. Most tapering regimens were limited to four weeks or less. In the studies with rapid tapering schemes the risk of withdrawal symptoms may be similar to studies using abrupt discontinuation which may influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Nearly all data come from people with recurrent depression.   There is an urgent need for trials that adequately address withdrawal confounding bias, and carefully distinguish relapse from withdrawal symptoms. Future studies should report key outcomes such as  successful discontinuation rate  and should include populations with one or no prior depression episodes in primary care, older people, and people taking antidepressants for anxiety and use tapering schemes longer than 4 weeks.",

    "query": "Title: Antidepressants for people with epilepsy and depression\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDepressive disorders are the most common psychiatric comorbidity in people with epilepsy, affecting around one‐third, with a significant negative impact on quality of life. There is concern that people may not be receiving appropriate treatment for their depression because of uncertainty regarding which antidepressant or class works best, and the perceived risk of exacerbating seizures. This review aimed to address these issues, and inform clinical practice and future research. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 12, 2014. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms and the effect on seizure recurrence, in people with epilepsy and depression. \nSearch methods:\nFor this update, we searched CRS Web, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2021). We searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry in October 2019, but were unable to update it because it was inaccessible. There were no language restrictions. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), investigating children or adults with epilepsy, who were treated with an antidepressant and compared to placebo, comparative antidepressant, psychotherapy, or no treatment for depressive symptoms.  \nData collection and analysis:\nThe primary outcomes were changes in depression scores (proportion with a greater than 50% improvement, mean difference, and proportion who achieved complete remission) and change in seizure frequency (mean difference, proportion with a seizure recurrence, or episode of status epilepticus). Secondary outcomes included the number of participants who withdrew from the study and reasons for withdrawal, quality of life, cognitive functioning, and adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data for each included study. We then cross‐checked the data extraction. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for RCTs, and the ROBINS‐I for NRSIs. We presented binary outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or 99% CIs for specific adverse events. We presented continuous outcomes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs, and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs.  \nMain results:\nWe included 10 studies in the review (four RCTs and six NRSIs), with 626 participants with epilepsy and depression, examining the effects of antidepressants. One RCT was a multi‐centre study comparing an antidepressant with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The other three RCTs were single‐centre studies comparing an antidepressant with an active control, placebo, or no treatment. The NRSIs reported on outcomes mainly in participants with focal epilepsy before and after treatment for depression with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); one NRSI compared SSRIs to CBT.  We rated one RCT at low risk of bias, three RCTs at unclear risk of bias, and all six NRSIs at serious risk of bias. We were unable to conduct any meta‐analysis of RCT data due to heterogeneity of treatment comparisons. We judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate to very low across comparisons, because single studies contributed limited outcome data, and because of risk of bias, particularly for NRSIs, which did not adjust for confounding variables. More than 50% improvement in depressive symptoms ranged from 43% to 82% in RCTs, and from 24% to 97% in NRSIs, depending on the antidepressant given. Venlafaxine improved depressive symptoms by more than 50% compared to no treatment (mean difference (MD) ‐7.59 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐11.52 to ‐3.66; 1 study, 64 participants; low‐certainty evidence); the results between other comparisons were inconclusive. Two studies comparing SSRIs to CBT reported inconclusive results for the proportion of participants who achieved complete remission of depressive symptoms.  Seizure frequency data did not suggest an increased risk of seizures with antidepressants compared to control treatments or baseline. Two studies measured quality of life; antidepressants did not appear to improve quality of life over control. No studies reported on cognitive functioning. Two RCTs and one NRSI reported comparative data on adverse events; antidepressants did not appear to increase the severity or number of adverse events compared to controls. The NSRIs reported higher rates of withdrawals due to adverse events than lack of efficacy. Reported adverse events for antidepressants included nausea, dizziness, sedation, headache, gastrointestinal disturbance, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction.  \nAuthors' conclusions:\nExisting evidence on the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating depressive symptoms associated with epilepsy is still very limited. Rates of response to antidepressants were highly variable. There is low certainty evidence from one small RCT (64 participants) that venlafaxine may improve depressive symptoms more than no treatment; this evidence is limited to treatment between 8 and 16 weeks, and does not inform longer‐term effects. Moderate to low evidence suggests neither an increase nor exacerbation of seizures with SSRIs.  There are no available comparative data to inform the choice of antidepressant drug or classes of drug for efficacy or safety for treating people with epilepsy and depression. RCTs of antidepressants utilising interventions from other treatment classes besides SSRIs, in large samples of patients with epilepsy and depression, are needed to better inform treatment policy. Future studies should assess interventions across a longer treatment duration to account for delayed onset of action, sustainability of treatment responses, and to provide a better understanding of the impact on seizure control.",

    "query": "Title: Smoking cessation for improving mental health\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nThere is a common perception that smoking generally helps people to manage stress, and may be a form of 'self‐medication' in people with mental health conditions. However, there are biologically plausible reasons why smoking may worsen mental health through neuroadaptations arising from chronic smoking, leading to frequent nicotine withdrawal symptoms (e.g. anxiety, depression, irritability), in which case smoking cessation may help to improve rather than worsen mental health. \nObjectives:\nTo examine the association between tobacco smoking cessation and change in mental health. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the trial registries clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from 14 April 2012 to 07 January 2020. These were updated searches of a previously‐conducted non‐Cochrane review where searches were conducted from database inception to 13 April 2012.  \nSelection criteria:\nWe included controlled before‐after studies, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) analysed by smoking status at follow‐up, and longitudinal cohort studies. In order to be eligible for inclusion studies had to recruit adults who smoked tobacco, and assess whether they quit or continued smoking during the study. They also had to measure a mental health outcome at baseline and at least six weeks later. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcomes were change in depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms or mixed anxiety and depression symptoms between baseline and follow‐up. Secondary outcomes  included change in symptoms of stress, psychological quality of life, positive affect, and social impact or social quality of life, as well as new incidence of depression, anxiety, or mixed anxiety and depression disorders. We assessed the risk of bias for the primary outcomes using a modified ROBINS‐I tool.  For change in mental health outcomes, we calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the difference in change in mental health from baseline to follow‐up between those who had quit smoking and those who had continued to smoke. For the incidence of psychological disorders, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. For all meta‐analyses we used a generic inverse variance random‐effects model and quantified statistical heterogeneity using I 2 . We conducted subgroup analyses to investigate any differences in associations between sub‐populations, i.e. unselected people with mental illness, people with physical chronic diseases. We assessed the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes (depression, anxiety, and mixed depression and anxiety) and our secondary social impact outcome using the eight GRADE considerations relevant to non‐randomised studies (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias, magnitude of the effect, the influence of all plausible residual confounding, the presence of a dose‐response gradient). \nMain results:\nWe included 102 studies representing over 169,500 participants. Sixty‐two of these were identified in the updated search for this review and 40 were included in the original version of the review.  Sixty‐three studies provided data on change in mental health, 10 were included in meta‐analyses of incidence of mental health disorders, and 31 were synthesised narratively.  For all primary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with an improvement in mental health symptoms compared with continuing to smoke: anxiety symptoms (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.43 to −0.13; 15 studies, 3141 participants; I 2  = 69%; low‐certainty evidence); depression symptoms: (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.21; 34 studies, 7156 participants; I 2  = 69%' very low‐certainty evidence);  mixed anxiety and depression symptoms (SMD −0.31, 95% CI −0.40 to −0.22; 8 studies, 2829 participants; I 2  = 0%; moderate certainty evidence).  These findings were robust to preplanned sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analysis generally did not produce evidence of differences in the effect size among subpopulations or based on methodological characteristics. All studies were deemed to be at serious risk of bias due to possible time‐varying confounding, and three studies measuring depression symptoms were judged to be at critical risk of bias overall. There was also some evidence of funnel plot asymmetry. For these reasons, we rated our certainty in the estimates for anxiety as low, for depression as very low, and for mixed anxiety and depression as moderate. For the secondary outcomes, smoking cessation was associated with an improvement in symptoms of stress (SMD −0.19, 95% CI −0.34 to −0.04; 4 studies, 1792 participants; I 2  = 50%), positive affect (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.33; 13 studies, 4880 participants; I 2  = 75%), and psychological quality of life (SMD 0.11, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 19 studies, 18,034 participants; I 2  = 42%). There was also evidence that smoking cessation was not associated with a reduction in social quality of life, with the confidence interval incorporating the possibility of a small improvement (SMD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06; 9 studies, 14,673 participants; I 2  = 0%). The incidence of new mixed anxiety and depression was lower in people who stopped smoking compared with those who continued (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86; 3 studies, 8685 participants; I 2  = 57%), as was the incidence of anxiety disorder (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.12; 2 studies, 2293 participants; I 2  = 46%). We deemed it inappropriate to present a pooled estimate for the incidence of new cases of clinical depression, as there was high statistical heterogeneity (I 2  = 87%). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nTaken together, these data provide evidence that mental health does not worsen as a result of quitting smoking, and very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that smoking cessation is associated with small to moderate improvements in mental health.  These improvements are seen in both unselected samples and in subpopulations, including people diagnosed with mental health conditions. Additional studies that use more advanced methods to overcome time‐varying confounding would strengthen the evidence in this area.",

    "query": "Title: Interventions for self‐harm in children and adolescents\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSelf‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of SH in children and adolescents is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions in adults. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of interventions for SH in children and adolescents. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of care (e.g. treatment‐as‐usual, routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care, active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these) for children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) who engage in SH. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialized Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing specific psychosocial interventions or pharmacological agents or natural products with treatment‐as‐usual (TAU), routine psychiatric care, enhanced usual care (EUC), active comparator, placebo, alternative pharmacological treatment, or a combination of these, in children and adolescents with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included data from 17 trials with a total of 2280 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (87.6%) with a mean age of 14.7 years (standard deviation (SD) 1.5 years). The trials included in this review investigated the effectiveness of various forms of psychosocial interventions. None of the included trials evaluated the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in this clinical population. There was a lower rate of SH repetition for DBT‐A (30%) as compared to TAU, EUC, or alternative psychotherapy (43%) on repetition of SH at post‐intervention in four trials (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.82; N = 270; k = 4; high‐certainty evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference for individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)‐based psychotherapy and TAU for repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.12 to 7.24; N = 51; k = 2; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether mentalisation based therapy for adolescents (MBT‐A) reduces repetition of SH at post‐intervention as compared to TAU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.06 to 8.46; N = 85; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). Heterogeneity for this outcome was substantial ( I² = 68%). There is probably no evidence of a difference between family therapy and either TAU or EUC on repetition of SH at post‐intervention (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.07; N = 191; k = 2; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference for compliance enhancement approaches on repetition of SH by the six‐month follow‐up assessment, for group‐based psychotherapy at the six‐ or 12‐month follow‐up assessments, for a remote contact intervention (emergency cards) at the 12‐month assessment, or for therapeutic assessment at the 12‐ or 24‐month follow‐up assessments. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nGiven the moderate or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding a number of psychosocial interventions in children and adolescents who engage in SH. Further evaluation of DBT‐A is warranted. Given the evidence for its benefit in adults who engage in SH, individual CBT‐based psychotherapy should also be further developed and evaluated in children and adolescents.",

    "query": "Title: Prevention of depression in adults with long‐term physical conditions\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMajor depression is one of the world’s leading causes of disability in adults with long‐term physical conditions compared to those without physical illness. This co‐morbidity is associated with a negative prognosis in terms of increased morbidity and mortality rates, increased healthcare costs, decreased adherence to treatment regimens, and a substantial decline in quality of life. Therefore, preventing the onset of depressive episodes in adults with long‐term physical conditions should be a global healthcare aim. In this review, primary or tertiary (in cases of preventing recurrences in those with a history of depression) prevention are the focus. While primary prevention aims at preventing the onset of depression, tertiary prevention comprises both preventing recurrences and prohibiting relapses. Tertiary prevention aims to address a depressive episode that might still be present, is about to subside, or has recently resolved. We included tertiary prevention in the case where the focus was preventing the onset of depression in those with a history of depression (preventing recurrences) but excluded it if it specifically focused on maintaining an condition or implementing rehabilitation services (relapse prevention). Secondary prevention of depression seeks to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms by early detection and treatment and may therefore be considered a 'treatment,' rather than prevention. We therefore exclude the whole spectrum of secondary prevention. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of psychological or pharmacological interventions, in comparison to control conditions, in preventing depression in adults with long‐term physical conditions; either before first ever onset of depressive symptoms (i.e. primary prevention) or before first onset of depressive symptoms in patients with a history of depression (i.e. tertiary prevention). \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and two trials registries, up to 6 February 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive psychological or pharmacological interventions, specifically targeting incidence of depression in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list, attention/psychological placebo, or placebo. Participants had to be age 18 years or older, with at least one long‐term physical condition, and no diagnosis of major depression at baseline (primary prevention). In addition, we included studies comprising mixed samples of patients with and without a history of depression, which explored tertiary prevention of recurrent depression. We excluded other tertiary prevention studies. We also excluded secondary preventive interventions. Primary outcomes included incidence of depression, tolerability, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included severity of depression, cost‐effectiveness and cost‐utility. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. \nMain results:\nWe included 11 RCTs, with one trial on psychological interventions, and 10 trials on pharmacological interventions. Data analyses on the psychological intervention (problem‐solving therapy compared to TAU) included 194 participants with age‐related macular degeneration. Data analyses on pharmacological interventions included 837 participants comparing citalopram (one trial), escitalopram (three trials), a mixed sample of fluoxetine/nortriptyline (one trial), melatonin (one trial), milnacipran (one trial), and sertraline (three trials), each to placebo. Included types of long‐term physical conditions were acute coronary syndrome (one trial), breast cancer (one trial), head and neck cancer (two trials), stroke (five trials), and traumatic brain injury (one trial). Psychological interventions Very low‐certainty evidence of one study suggests that problem solving therapy may be slightly more effective than TAU in preventing the incidence of depression, immediately post‐intervention (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.95; 194 participants). However, there may be little to no difference between groups at six months follow‐up (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.38; 190 participants; one study; very low‐certainty evidence). No data were available regarding incidence of depression after six months. Regarding acceptability (drop‐outs due to any cause), slightly fewer drop‐outs occurred in the TAU group immediately post‐intervention (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 24.40; 206 participants; low‐certainty evidence). After six months, however, the groups did not differ (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.58 to 4.77; 206 participants; low‐certainty evidence). This study did not measure tolerability. Pharmacological interventions Post‐intervention, compared to placebo, antidepressants may be beneficial in preventing depression in adults with different types of long‐term physical conditions, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49; 814 participants; nine studies; I 2  =0%; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups both immediately and at six months follow‐up (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.46; 23 participants; one study; very low‐certainty evidence) as well as at six to 12 months follow‐up (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.82; 233 participants; three studies; I 2  = 49%; very low‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from five studies regarding the tolerability of the pharmacological intervention. A total of 669 adverse events were observed in 316 participants from the pharmacological intervention group, and 610 adverse events from 311 participants in the placebo group. There was very low‐certainty evidence that drop‐outs due to adverse events may be less frequent in the placebo group (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.89; 561 participants; five studies; I 2  = 0%). There was also very low‐certainty evidence that drop‐outs due to any cause may not differ between groups either post‐intervention (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73; 962 participants; nine studies; I 2  = 28%), or at six to 12 months (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 327 participants; three studies; I 2  = 0%). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nBased on evidence of very low certainty, our results may indicate the benefit of pharmacological interventions, during or directly after preventive treatment. Few trials examined short‐term outcomes up to six months, nor the follow‐up effects at six to 12 months, with studies suffering from great numbers of drop‐outs and inconclusive results. Generalisation of results is limited as study populations and treatment regimes were very heterogeneous. Based on the results of this review, we conclude that for adults with long‐term physical conditions, there is only very uncertain evidence regarding the implementation of any primary preventive interventions (psychological/pharmacological) for depression.",
    "reference_answer": "### Scoring Reference Points for Main Findings\n\n**Psychological Interventions**\n- **Effectiveness (Incidence of Depression)**\n  - Immediate post-intervention: Problem-solving therapy may slightly reduce the incidence of depression compared to treatment as usual (TAU).

    "query": "Title: Second‐generation antidepressants for treatment of seasonal affective disorder\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent depressive episodes that is often treated with second‐generation antidepressants (SGAs), light therapy, or psychotherapy. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of second‐generation antidepressants (SGAs) for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in adults in comparison with placebo, light therapy, other SGAs, or psychotherapy. \nSearch methods:\nThis is an update of an earlier review first published in 2011. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (all years), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (2011 to January 2020), together with the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) (all available years), for reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We hand searched the reference lists of all included studies and other systematic reviews. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished/ongoing trials. We ran a separate update search for reports of adverse events in the Ovid databases.  \nSelection criteria:\nFor efficacy we included RCTs of SGAs compared with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, or psychotherapy in adult participants with SAD. For adverse events we also included non‐randomised studies. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment were conducted individually. We pooled data for meta‐analysis where the participant groups were similar, and the studies assessed the same treatments with the same comparator and had similar definitions of outcome measures over a similar duration of treatment. \nMain results:\nIn this update we identified no new RCT on the effectiveness of SGAs in SAD patients. We included 2 additional single‐arm observational studies that reported on adverse events of SGAs.  For efficacy we included three RCTs of between five and eight weeks' duration with a total of 204 participants. For adverse events we included two RCTs and five observational (non‐randomised) studies of five to eight weeks' duration with a total of 249 participants. All participants met the DSM ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ) criteria for SAD. The average age ranged from 34 to 42 years, and the majority of participants were female (66% to 100%). Results from one trial with 68 participants showed that fluoxetine (20/36) was numerically superior to placebo (11/32) in achieving clinical response; however, the confidence interval (CI) included both a potential benefit as well as no benefit of fluoxetine (risk ratio (RR) 1.62, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.83, very low‐certainty evidence). The number of adverse events was similar in both groups (very low‐certainty evidence). Two trials involving a total of 136 participants compared fluoxetine versus light therapy. Meta‐analysis showed fluoxetine and light therapy to be approximately equal in treating seasonal depression: RR of response 0.98 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.24, low‐certainty evidence), RR of remission 0.81 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.71, very low‐certainty evidence). The number of adverse events was similar in both groups (low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any eligible study comparing SGA with another SGA or with psychotherapy. Two RCTs and five non‐randomised studies reported adverse event data on a total of 249 participants who received bupropion, fluoxetine, escitalopram, duloxetine, nefazodone, reboxetine, light therapy, or placebo. We were only able to obtain crude rates of adverse events, therefore caution is advised regarding interpretation of this information. Between 0% and 100% of participants who received an SGA suffered an adverse event, and between 0% and 25% of participants withdrew from the study due to adverse events. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nEvidence for the effectiveness of SGAs is limited to one small trial of fluoxetine compared with placebo showing a non‐significant effect in favour of fluoxetine, and two small trials comparing fluoxetine against light therapy suggesting equivalence between the two interventions. The lack of available evidence precluded us from drawing any overall conclusions on the use of SGAs for SAD. Further, larger RCTs are required to expand and strengthen the evidence base on this topic, and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other SGAs. Data on adverse events were sparse, and a comparative analysis was not possible. The data we obtained on adverse events is therefore not robust, and our confidence in the data is limited. Overall, up to 25% of participants treated with SGAs for SAD withdrew from the study early due to adverse events.",
    "reference_answer": "To create a comprehensive set of scoring reference points for the main findings of the research on second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) for the treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), the following bullet points can be outlined based on the provided abstract and highlighted findings:\n\n- **Efficacy of SGAs (Fluoxetine vs. Placebo):**\n  - Score 1: Evidence from one small trial (n=68) indicated fluoxetine was numerically superior to placebo in achieving clinical response.\n  - Score 2: The finding of fluoxetine's superiority was of very low-certainty due to wide confidence intervals which included both potential benefit and no benefit (CI: 0.92 to 2.83).\n\n- **Comparison of Fluoxetine vs. Light Therapy:**\n  - Score 3: Two trials (n=136) found fluoxetine and light therapy to be approximately equal in treating seasonal depression (RR of response 0.98).\n  - Score 4: The evidence from the trials comparing fluoxetine and light therapy was characterized as low to very low certainty, affecting confidence in these findings.\n\n- **Adverse Events:**\n  - Score 5: Adverse event data were limited, and a comparative analysis between SGAs could not be conducted reliably.\n  - Score 6: Up to 25% of participants treated with SGAs withdrew from studies early due to adverse events, indicating a significant rate of adverse events warranting attention.\n  - Score 7: Adverse event data was based on crude rates across various studies, making robust conclusions difficult.\n\n- **Overall Evidence and Recommendations:**\n  - Score 8: The study highlights a scarcity of rigorous trials, underscoring the need for further, larger randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve the evidence base.\n  - Score 9: Future studies are recommended to compare SGAs with psychotherapy and among other SGAs to derive more comprehensive insights.\n"

    "query": "Title: Cholinesterase inhibitors for vascular dementia and other vascular cognitive impairments: a network meta‐analysis\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nVascular cognitive impairment (VCI) describes a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments caused by cerebrovascular disease, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. There are currently no pharmacological treatments recommended for improving either cognition or function in people with VCI. Three cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) are licenced for the treatment of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. They are thought to work by compensating for reduced cholinergic neurotransmission, which is also a feature of VCI. Through pairwise comparisons with placebo and a network meta‐analysis, we sought to determine whether these medications are effective in VCI and whether there are differences between them with regard to efficacy or adverse events. \nObjectives:\n(1) To assess the efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of adults with vascular dementia and other VCI. (2) To compare the effects of different cholinesterase inhibitors on cognition and adverse events, using network meta‐analysis. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 19 August 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials in which donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine was compared with placebo or in which the drugs were compared with each other in adults with vascular dementia or other VCI (excluding cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)). We included all drug doses and routes of administration. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently identified eligible trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcomes were cognition, clinical global impression, function (performance of activities of daily living), and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, incidence of development of new dementia, behavioural disturbance, carer burden, institutionalisation, quality of life and death. For the pairwise analyses, we pooled outcome data at similar time points using random‐effects methods. We also performed a network meta‐analysis using Bayesian methods. \nMain results:\nWe included eight trials (4373 participants) in the review. Three trials studied donepezil 5 mg or 10 mg daily (n= 2193); three trials studied rivastigmine at a maximum daily dose of 3 to 12 mg (n= 800); and two trials studied galantamine at a maximum daily dose of 16 to 24 mg (n= 1380). The trials included participants with possible or probable vascular dementia or cognitive impairment following stroke. Mean ages were between 72.2 and 73.9 years. All of the trials were at low or unclear risk of bias in all domains, and the evidence ranged from very low to high level of certainty. For cognition, the results showed that donepezil 5 mg improves cognition slightly, although the size of the effect is unlikely to be clinically important (mean difference (MD) −0.92 Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive Subscale (ADAS‐Cog) points (range 0 to 70), 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.44 to −0.40; high‐certainty evidence). Donepezil 10 mg (MD −2.21 ADAS‐Cog points, 95% CI −3.07 to −1.35; moderate‐certainty evidence) and galantamine 16 to 24 mg (MD −2.01 ADAS‐Cog point, 95%CI −3.18 to −0.85; moderate‐certainty evidence) probably also improve cognition, although the larger effect estimates still may not be clinically important. With low certainty, there may be little to no effect of rivastigmine 3 to 12 mg daily on cognition (MD 0.03 ADAS‐Cog points, 95% CI −3.04 to 3.10; low‐certainty evidence). Adverse events reported in the studies included nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, headache, and hypertension. The results showed that there was probably little to no difference between donepezil 5 mg and placebo in the number of adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.58; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there were slightly more adverse events with donepezil 10 mg than with placebo (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.15; high‐certainty evidence). The effect of rivastigmine 3 to 12 mg on adverse events was very uncertain (OR 3.21, 95% CI 0.36 to 28.88; very low‐certainty evidence). Galantamine 16 to 24 mg is probably associated with a slight excess of adverse events over placebo (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.43; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the network meta‐analysis (NMA), we included cognition to represent benefit, and adverse events to represent harm. All drugs ranked above placebo for cognition and below placebo for adverse events. We found donepezil 10 mg to rank first in terms of benefit, but third in terms of harms, when considering the network estimates and quality of evidence. Galantamine was ranked second in terms of both benefit and harm. Rivastigmine had the lowest ranking of the cholinesterase inhibitors in both benefit and harm NMA estimates, but this may reflect possibly inadequate doses received by some trial participants and small trial sample sizes. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence that donepezil 5 mg, donepezil 10 mg, and galantamine have a slight beneficial effect on cognition in people with VCI, although the size of the change is unlikely to be clinically important. Donepezil 10 mg and galantamine 16 to 24 mg are probably associated with more adverse events than placebo. The evidence for rivastigmine was less certain. The data suggest that donepezil 10 mg has the greatest effect on cognition, but at the cost of adverse effects. The effect is modest, but in the absence of any other treatments, people living with VCI may still wish to consider the use of these agents. Further research into rivastigmine is needed, including the use of transdermal patches.",
    "reference_answer": "Here is a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings from the study:\n\n- **Donepezil 5 mg Efficacy**:\n  - Slightly improves cognition in VCI (Mean Difference −0.92 ADAS-Cog points).\n  - High-certainty evidence shows effect size is unlikely to be clinically important.\n\n- **Donepezil 5 mg Adverse Events**:\n  - Moderate-certainty evidence indicates probably little to no difference in adverse events compared to placebo (Odds Ratio 1.22).\n\n- **Donepezil 10 mg Efficacy**:\n  - Shows moderate-certainty evidence of slight cognition improvement in VCI (Mean Difference −2.21 ADAS-Cog points).\n\n- **Donepezil 10 mg Adverse Events**:\n  - High-certainty evidence of more adverse events compared to placebo (Odds Ratio 1.95).\n  - Ranks first in cognitive benefit, third in terms of harms in NMA estimates.\n\n- **Galantamine Efficacy**:\n  - Moderate-certainty evidence shows slight improvement in cognition for VCI (Mean Difference −2.01 ADAS-Cog points).\n\n- **Galantamine Adverse Events**:\n  - Moderate-certainty evidence indicates a slight excess of adverse events compared to placebo (Odds Ratio 1.57).\n  - Ranks second in terms of both benefit and harm in NMA estimates.\n\n- **Rivastigmine Efficacy**:\n  - Low-certainty evidence with possibly inadequate doses, showing little to no effect on cognition (Mean Difference 0.03 ADAS-Cog points).\n\n- **Rivastigmine Adverse Events**:\n  - Very low-certainty evidence with uncertain effect on adverse events (Odds Ratio 3.21).\n  - Lowest ranking in benefit and harm according to NMA estimates due to sample size and dose issues.\n\n- **General Findings**:\n  - All drugs ranked above placebo for cognitive benefit and below for adverse events in network meta-analysis.\n  - Donepezil 10 mg and galantamine 16 to 24 mg likely have more adverse effects than placebo.\n  - Further research into rivastigmine, including different administration methods, is warranted due to uncertainty in current evidence.\n\nThese points represent essential scoring criteria used for evaluating the study's findings on cholinesterase inhibitors in treating vascular cognitive impairment."

    "query": "Title: Interventions for preventing type 2 diabetes in adults with mental disorders in low‐ and middle‐income countries\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increased in individuals with mental disorders. Much of the burden of disease falls on the populations of low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of pharmacological, behaviour change, and organisational interventions versus active and non‐active comparators in the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes among people with mental illness in LMICs. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and six other databases, as well as three international trials registries. We also searched conference proceedings and checked the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. Searches are current up to 20 February 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological, behavioural or organisational interventions targeting the prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes in adults with mental disorders in LMICs. \nData collection and analysis:\nPairs of review authors working independently performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments. We conducted meta‐analyses using random‐effects models. \nMain results:\nOne hospital‐based RCT with 150 participants (99 participants with schizophrenia) addressed our review's primary outcome of prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes onset. Low‐certainty evidence from this study did not show a difference between atypical and typical antipsychotics in the development of diabetes at six weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 7.05) (among a total 99 participants with schizophrenia, 68 were in atypical and 31 were in typical antipsychotic groups; 55 participants without mental illness were not considered in the analysis). An additional 29 RCTs with 2481 participants assessed one or more of the review's secondary outcomes. All studies were conducted in hospital settings and reported on pharmacological interventions. One study, which we could not include in our meta‐analysis, included an intervention with pharmacological and behaviour change components. We identified no studies of organisational interventions. Low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence suggests there may be no difference between the use of atypical and typical antipsychotics for the outcomes of drop‐outs from care (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.69; two studies with 144 participants), and fasting blood glucose levels (mean difference (MD) 0.05 lower, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.00; two studies with 211 participants). Participants who receive typical antipsychotics may have a lower body mass index (BMI) at follow‐up than participants who receive atypical antipsychotics (MD 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.81; two studies with 141 participants; moderate certainty of evidence), and may have lower total cholesterol levels eight weeks after starting treatment (MD 0.35, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.43; one study with 112 participants). There was moderate certainty evidence suggesting no difference between the use of metformin and placebo for the outcomes of drop‐outs from care (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 16.35; three studies with 158 participants). There was moderate‐to‐high certainty evidence of no difference between metformin and placebo for fasting blood glucose levels (endpoint data: MD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.60 to ‐0.11; change from baseline data: MD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.22; five studies with 264 participants). There was high certainty evidence that BMI was lower for participants receiving metformin compared with those receiving a placebo (MD ‐1.37, 95% CI ‐2.04 to ‐0.70; five studies with 264 participants; high certainty of evidence). There was no difference between metformin and placebo for the outcomes of waist circumference, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Low‐certainty evidence from one study (48 participants) suggests there may be no difference between the use of melatonin and placebo for the outcome of drop‐outs from care (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.66). Fasting blood glucose is probably reduced more in participants treated with melatonin compared with placebo (endpoint data: MD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.01; change from baseline data: MD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.39 to ‐0.09; three studies with 202 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no difference between melatonin and placebo for the outcomes of waist circumference, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Very low‐certainty evidence from one study (25 participants) suggests that drop‐outs may be higher in participants treated with a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) compared with those receiving a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.01). It is uncertain if there is no difference in fasting blood glucose levels between these groups (MD ‐0.39, 95% CI ‐0.88 to 0.10; three studies with 141 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if there is no difference in BMI and depression between the TCA and SSRI antidepressant groups. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOnly one study reported data on our primary outcome of interest, providing low‐certainty evidence that there may be no difference in risk between atypical and typical antipsychotics for the outcome of developing type 2 diabetes. We are therefore not able to draw conclusions on the prevention of type 2 diabetes in people with mental disorders in LMICs. For studies reporting on secondary outcomes, there was evidence of risk of bias in the results. There is a need for further studies with participants from LMICs with mental disorders, particularly on behaviour change and on organisational interventions targeting prevention of type 2 diabetes in these populations.",

    "query": "Title: Antidepressant treatment for postnatal depression\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDepression is one of the most common morbidities of the postnatal period. It has been associated with adverse outcomes for women, children, the wider family and society as a whole. Treatment is with psychosocial interventions or antidepressant medication, or both. The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of different antidepressants and to compare their effectiveness with placebo, treatment as usual or other forms of treatment. This is an update of a review last published in 2014. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in comparison with any other treatment (psychological, psychosocial, or pharmacological), placebo, or treatment as usual for postnatal depression. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched Cochrane Common Mental Disorders's Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO in May 2020. We also searched international trials registries and contacted experts in the field. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with depression during the first 12 months postpartum that compared antidepressant treatment (alone or in combination with another treatment) with any other treatment, placebo or treatment as usual. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently extracted data from the study reports. We requested missing information from study authors wherever possible. We sought data to allow an intention‐to‐treat analysis. Where we identified sufficient comparable studies we pooled data and conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses. \nMain results:\nWe identified 11 RCTs (1016 women), the majority of which were from English‐speaking, high‐income countries; two were from middle‐income countries. Women were recruited from a mix of community‐based, primary care, maternity and outpatient settings. Most studies used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with treatment duration ranging from 4 to 12 weeks. Meta‐analysis showed that there may be a benefit of SSRIs over placebo in response (55% versus 43%; pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.66); remission (42% versus 27%; RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.41); and reduced depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.30, 95% CI −0.55 to −0.05; 4 studies, 251 women), at 5 to 12 weeks' follow‐up. We were unable to conduct meta‐analysis for adverse events due to variation in the reporting of this between studies. There was no evidence of a difference between acceptability of SSRI and placebo (27% versus 27%; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.64; 4 studies; 233 women). The certainty of all the evidence for SSRIs was low or very low due to the small number of included studies and a number of potential sources of bias, including high rates of attrition. There was insufficient evidence to assess the efficacy of SSRIs compared with other classes of antidepressants and of antidepressants compared with other pharmacological interventions, complementary medicines, psychological and psychosocial interventions or treatment as usual. A substantial proportion of women experienced adverse effects but there was no evidence of differences in the number of adverse effects between treatment groups in any of the studies. Data on effects on children, including breastfed infants, parenting, and the wider family were limited, although no adverse effects were noted. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere remains limited evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants in the management of postnatal depression, particularly for those with more severe depression. We found low‐certainty evidence that SSRI antidepressants may be more effective in treating postnatal depression than placebo as measured by response and remission rates. However, the low certainty of the evidence suggests that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our effect estimate. There is a continued imperative to better understand whether, and for whom, antidepressants or other treatments are more effective for postnatal depression, and whether some antidepressants are more effective or better tolerated than others. In clinical practice, the findings of this review need to be contextualised by the extensive broader literature on antidepressants in the general population and perinatal clinical guidance, to inform an individualised risk‐benefit clinical decision. Future RCTs should focus on larger samples, longer follow‐up, comparisons with alternative treatment modalities and inclusion of child and parenting outcomes.",

    "query": "Title: Video games for people with schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nCommercial video games are a vastly popular form of recreational activity. Whilst concerns persist regarding possible negative effects of video games, they have been suggested to provide cognitive benefits to users. They are also frequently employed as control interventions in comparisons of more complex cognitive or psychological interventions. If independently effective, video games ‐ being both engaging and relatively inexpensive ‐ could provide a much more cost‐effective add‐on intervention to standard treatment when compared to costly, cognitive interventions. \nObjectives:\nTo review the effects of video games (alone or as an additional intervention) compared to standard care alone or other interventions including, but not limited to, cognitive remediation or cognitive behavioural therapy for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (March 2017, August 2018, August 2019). \nSelection criteria:\nRandomised controlled trials focusing on video games for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. \nData collection and analysis:\nReview authors extracted data independently. For binary outcomes we calculated risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its CI. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. \nMain results:\nThis review includes seven trials conducted between 2009 and 2018 (total = 468 participants, range 32 to 121). Study duration varied from six weeks to twelve weeks. All interventions in the included trials were given in addition to standard care, including prescribed medication. In trials video games tend to be the control for testing efficacy of complex, cognitive therapies; only two small trials evaluated commercial video games as the intervention. We categorised video game interventions into 'non‐exergame' (played statically) and 'exergame' (the players use bodily movements to control the game). Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important changes in: general functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, and physical fitness as well as clinically important adverse effects.  We found no clear difference between non‐exergames and cognitive remediation in general functioning scores (Strauss Carpenter Outcome Scale) (MD 0.42, 95% CI −0.62 to 1.46; participants = 86; studies = 1,  very low‐ quality  evidence ) or social functioning scores (Specific Levels of Functioning Scale) (MD −3.13, 95% CI ‐40.17 to 33.91; participants = 53; studies = 1,  very low‐ quality  evidence ). There was a clear difference favouring cognitive remediation for cognitive functioning (improved on at least one domain of MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery Test) (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.99; participants = 42; studies = 1,  low‐ quality  evidence ). For mental state, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) overall scores showed no clear difference between treatment groups (MD 0.20, 95% CI −3.89 to 4.28; participants = 269; studies = 4,  low‐ quality  evidence ). Quality of life ratings (Quality of Life Scale) similarly showed no clear intergroup difference (MD 0.01, 95% CI −0.40 to 0.42; participants = 87; studies = 1,  very low‐ quality  evidence) . Adverse effects were not reported; we chose leaving the study early as a proxy measure. The attrition rate by end of treatment was similar between treatment groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.06; participants = 395; studies = 5,  low‐ quality  evidence ).  One small trial compared exergames with standard care, but few outcomes were reported .  No clear difference between interventions was seen for cognitive functioning (measured by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery Test) (MD 2.90, 95% CI ‐1.27 to 7.07; participants = 33; studies = 1,  low‐ quality  evidence) , however a benefit in favour of exergames was found for average change in physical fitness (aerobic fitness) (MD 3.82, 95% CI 1.75 to 5.89; participants = 33; studies = 1,  low‐ quality  evidence) . Adverse effects were not reported; we chose leaving the study early as a proxy measure. The attrition rate by end of treatment was similar between treatment groups (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.51; participants = 33; studies = 1). Another small trial compared exergames with non‐exergames. Only one of our main outcomes was reported ‐ physical fitness, which was measured by average time taken to walk 3 metres. No clear intergroup difference was identified at six‐week follow‐up (MD −0.50, 95% CI −1.17 to 0.17; participants = 28; studies = 1,  very low‐ quality  evidence) . No trials reported adverse effects. We chose leaving the study early as a proxy outcome. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOur results suggest that non‐exergames may have a less beneficial effect on cognitive functioning than cognitive remediation, but have comparable effects for all other outcomes. These data are from a small number of trials, and the evidence is graded as of low or very low quality and is very likely to change with more data. It is difficult to currently establish if the more sophisticated cognitive approaches do any more good ‐ or harm ‐ than 'static' video games for people with schizophrenia. Where players use bodily movements to control the game (exergames), there is very limited evidence suggesting a possible benefit of exergames compared to standard care in terms of cognitive functioning and aerobic fitness. However, this finding must be replicated in trials with a larger sample size and that are conducted over a longer time frame. We cannot draw any firm conclusions regarding the effects of video games until more high‐quality evidence is available. There are ongoing studies that may provide helpful data in the near future.",
    "reference_answer": "To craft a set of scoring reference points based on the main findings of the abstract about video games for people with schizophrenia, here is a structured list:\n\n- **Cognitive Functioning:**\n  - *Non-Exergames vs. Cognitive Remediation:* Non-exergames may have a less beneficial effect compared to cognitive remediation (based on MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery Test scores).\n  - *Exergames vs. Standard Care:* Limited evidence suggests potential cognitive benefits of exergames compared to standard care.\n\n- **Aerobic Physical Fitness:**\n  - *Exergames vs. Standard Care:* Some evidence points to benefits of exergames in improving aerobic fitness compared to standard care.\n\n- **General Functioning:**\n  - No clear difference found between non-exergames and cognitive remediation in general functioning scores (Strauss Carpenter Outcome Scale).\n\n- **Social Functioning:**\n  - No clear difference observed between non-exergames and cognitive remediation in social functioning scores (Specific Levels of Functioning Scale).\n\n- **Mental State:**\n  - No clear intergroup difference in mental state (PANSS overall scores) between non-exergames, cognitive remediation, and standard care.\n\n- **Quality of Life:**\n  - No clear intergroup difference in quality of life ratings (Quality of Life Scale) between the intervention groups.\n\n- **Physical Fitness:**\n  - No clear difference between exergames and non-exergames in physical fitness outcomes at six-week follow-up, measured by time taken to walk 3 meters.\n\n- **Adverse Effects and Attrition:**\n  - Adverse effects were not directly reported; study dropout rates were used as a proxy measure.\n  - Attrition rates by end of treatment were similar across intervention groups.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - Most findings are based on low or very low-quality evidence, with outcomes likely to change as more data becomes available. \n\nThese criteria aim to provide a clear and concise summary of the study findings, facilitating comparison and evaluation of the interventions in question."

    "query": "Title: Withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine or both, in people with dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDementia is a progressive syndrome characterised by deterioration in memory, thinking and behaviour, and by impaired ability to perform daily activities. Two classes of drug ‐ cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine ‐ are widely licensed for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and rivastigmine is also licensed for Parkinson's disease dementia. These drugs are prescribed to alleviate symptoms and delay disease progression in these and sometimes in other forms of dementia. There are uncertainties about the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs in the long term and in severe dementia, about effects of withdrawal, and about the most appropriate time to discontinue treatment. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, in people with dementia on: cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional outcomes, rates of institutionalisation, adverse events, dropout from trials, mortality, quality of life and carer‐related outcomes. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register up to 17 October 2020 using terms appropriate for the retrieval of studies of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. The Specialised Register contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) which compared withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, with continuation of the same drug or drugs. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently assessed citations and full‐text articles for inclusion, extracted data from included trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Where trials were sufficiently similar, we pooled data for outcomes in the short term (up to 2 months after randomisation), medium term (3‐11 months) and long term (12 months or more).  We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. \nMain results:\nWe included six trials investigating cholinesterase inhibitor withdrawal, and one trial investigating withdrawal of either donepezil or memantine. No trials assessed withdrawal of memantine only. Drugs were withdrawn abruptly in five trials and stepwise in two trials. All participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, with severities ranging from mild to very severe, and were taking cholinesterase inhibitors without known adverse effects at baseline. The included trials randomised 759 participants to treatment groups relevant to this review. Study duration ranged from 6 weeks to 12 months.  There were too few included studies to allow planned subgroup analyses. We considered some studies to be at unclear or high risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition or reporting bias. Compared to continuing cholinesterase inhibitors, discontinuing treatment may be associated with worse cognitive function in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.64 to ‐0.21; 4 studies; low certainty), but the effect in the medium term is very uncertain (SMD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐0.87 to 0.07; 3 studies; very low certainty). In a sensitivity analysis omitting data from a study which only included participants who had shown a relatively poor prior response to donepezil, inconsistency was reduced and we found that cognitive function may be worse in the discontinuation group in the medium term (SMD ‐0.62; 95% CI ‐0.94 to ‐0.31). Data from one longer‐term study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor is probably associated with worse cognitive function at 12 months (mean difference (MD) ‐2.09 Standardised Mini‐Mental State Examination (SMMSE) points, 95% CI ‐3.43 to ‐0.75; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may make little or no difference to functional status in the short term (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.54 to 0.04; 2 studies; low certainty), and its effect in the medium term is uncertain (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.74 to ‐0.01; 2 studies; very low certainty). After 12 months, discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor probably results in greater functional impairment than continuing treatment (MD ‐3.38 Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) points, 95% CI ‐6.67 to ‐0.10; one study; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may be associated with a worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms over the short term and medium term, although we cannot exclude a minimal effect (SMD ‐ 0.48, 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.13; 2 studies; low certainty; and SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.47 to ‐0.08; 3 studies; low certainty, respectively). Data from one study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor may result in little to no change in neuropsychiatric status at 12 months (MD ‐0.87 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) points; 95% CI ‐8.42 to 6.68; moderate certainty). We found no clear evidence of an effect of discontinuation on dropout due to lack of medication efficacy or deterioration in overall medical condition (odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.76; 4 studies; low certainty), on number of adverse events (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; 4 studies; low certainty) or serious adverse events (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; 4 studies; low certainty), and on mortality (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.55; 5 studies; low certainty). Institutionalisation was reported in one trial, but it was not possible to extract data for the groups relevant to this review. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review suggests that  discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors may result in worse cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional status than continuing treatment, although this is supported by limited evidence, almost all of low or very low certainty. As all participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, our findings are not transferable to other dementia types. We were unable to determine whether the effects of discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors differed with baseline dementia severity. There is currently no evidence to guide decisions about discontinuing memantine. There is a need for further well‐designed RCTs, across a range of dementia severities and settings. We are aware of two ongoing registered trials. In making decisions about discontinuing these drugs, clinicians should exercise caution, considering the evidence from existing trials along with other factors important to patients and their carers.",

    "query": "Title: Pharmacological interventions for self‐harm in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSelf‐harm (SH; intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury regardless of degree of suicidal intent or other types of motivation) is a growing problem in most countries, often repeated, and associated with suicide. Evidence assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and/or natural products in the treatment of SH is lacking, especially when compared with the evidence for psychosocial interventions. This review therefore updates a previous Cochrane Review (last published in 2015) on the role of pharmacological interventions for SH in adults. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of pharmacological agents or natural products for SH compared to comparison types of treatment (e.g. placebo or alternative pharmacological treatment) for adults (aged 18 years or older) who engage in SH. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Library (Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL] and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR]), together with MEDLINE. Ovid Embase and PsycINFO (to 4 July 2020). \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological agents or natural products with placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment in individuals with a recent (within six months of trial entry) episode of SH resulting in presentation to hospital or clinical services. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a repeated episode of SH over a maximum follow‐up period of two years. Secondary outcomes included treatment acceptability, treatment adherence, depression, hopelessness, general functioning, social functioning, suicidal ideation, and suicide. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence internals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. The overall certainty of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. repetition of SH at post‐intervention) was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included data from seven trials with a total of 574 participants. Participants in these trials were predominately female (63.5%) with a mean age of 35.3 years (standard deviation (SD) 3.1 years). It is uncertain if newer generation antidepressants reduce repetition of SH compared to placebo (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.19; N = 129; k = 2; very low‐certainty evidence). There may be a lower rate of SH repetition for antipsychotics (21%) as compared to placebo (75%) (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.50; N = 30; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference between antipsychotics compared to another comparator drug/dose for repetition of SH (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.58; N = 53; k = 1; low‐certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference for mood stabilisers compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.95; N = 167; k = 1; very low‐certainty evidence), or for natural products compared to placebo for repetition of SH (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.62; N = 49; k = 1; lo‐ certainty) evidence. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nGiven the low or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, there is only uncertain evidence regarding pharmacological interventions in patients who engage in SH. More and larger trials of pharmacotherapy are required, preferably using newer agents. These might include evaluation of newer atypical antipsychotics. Further work should also include evaluation of adverse effects of pharmacological agents. Other research could include evaluation of combined pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment.",

    "query": "Title: Remotely delivered information, training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMany people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face‐to‐face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face‐to‐face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health‐related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. \nData collection and analysis:\nStudy selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta‐analyses using a random‐effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. \nMain results:\nWe included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self‐rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well‐reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.12); or health‐related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD ‐0.24, 95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health‐related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nRemotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health‐related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings.",

If effective, it might improve symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and also prevent the progression from prodromal Alzheimer's disease to dementia. We sought in this review to examine the evidence for this proposition. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of Souvenaid on incidence of dementia, cognition, functional performance, and safety in people with Alzheimer's disease. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, i.e. the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), Web of Science (ISI Web of Science), Cinahl (EBSCOhost), Lilacs (BIREME), and clinical trials registries up to 24 June 2020. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of landmark papers, reviews, and included studies for additional studies and assessed their suitability for inclusion in the review. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised, placebo‐controlled trials which evaluated Souvenaid in people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (also termed prodromal AD) or with dementia due to AD, and with a treatment duration of at least 16 weeks. \nData collection and analysis:\nOur primary outcome measures were incidence of dementia, global and specific cognitive function, functional performance, combined cognitive‐functional outcomes and adverse events. We selected studies, extracted data, assessed the quality of trials and intended to conduct meta‐analyses according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We present all outcomes grouped by stage of AD. \nMain results:\nWe included three randomised, placebo‐controlled trials investigating Souvenaid in 1097 community‐dwelling participants with Alzheimer's disease. One study each included participants with prodromal AD, mild AD dementia and mild‐to‐moderate AD dementia. We rated the risks of bias of all trials as low. One study (in prodromal AD) was funded by European grants. The other two studies were funded by the manufacturer of Souvenaid. One trial investigated the incidence of dementia in people with prodromal AD at baseline, and found little to no difference between the Souvenaid group and the placebo group after 24 months (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; 1 trial, 311 participants; moderate quality of evidence). In prodromal AD, and in mild and mild‐to‐moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia, Souvenaid probably results in little or no difference in global or specific cognitive functions (moderate quality of evidence). Everyday function, or the ability to perform activities of daily living, were measured in mild and mild‐to‐moderate AD dementia. Neither study found evidence of a difference between the groups after 24 weeks of treatment (moderate quality of evidence). Two studies investigated combined cognitive‐functional outcomes with the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes and observed conflicting results. Souvenaid probably results in slight improvement, which is below estimates of meaningful change, in participants with prodromal Alzheimer's disease after 24 months (moderate quality of evidence), but probably has little to no effect in mild‐to‐moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia after 24 weeks (moderate quality of evidence). Adverse effects observed were low in all trials, and the available data were insufficient to determine any connection with Souvenaid. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nTwo years of treatment with Souvenaid probably does not reduce the risk of progression to dementia in people with prodromal AD. There is no convincing evidence that Souvenaid affects other outcomes important to people with AD in the prodromal stage or mild‐to‐moderate stages of dementia. Conflicting evidence on combined cognitive‐functional outcomes in prodromal AD and mild AD dementia warrants further investigation. Adverse effects of Souvenaid seem to be uncommon, but the evidence synthesised in this review does not permit us to make a definitive statement on the long‐term tolerability of Souvenaid. The effects of Souvenaid in more severe AD dementia or in people with AD at risk of nutritional deficiencies remain unclear.",

    "query": "Title: Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPrevious Cochrane Reviews have shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders. However, questions remain regarding the following: up‐to‐date evidence of the relative efficacy and acceptability of CBT compared to waiting lists/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention controls, and alternative treatments; benefits across a range of outcomes; longer‐term effects; outcomes for different delivery formats; and amongst children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and children with intellectual impairments. \nObjectives:\nTo examine the effect of CBT for childhood anxiety disorders, in comparison with waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual (TAU), attention control, alternative treatment, and medication. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (all years to 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (each to October 2019), international trial registries, and conducted grey literature searches. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials of CBT that involved direct contact with the child, parent, or both, and included non‐CBT comparators (waitlist/no treatment, treatment as usual, attention control, alternative treatment, medication). Participants were younger than age 19, and met diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Primary outcomes were remission of primary anxiety diagnosis post‐treatment, and acceptability (number of participants lost to post‐treatment assessment), and secondary outcomes included remission of all anxiety diagnoses, reduction in anxiety symptoms, reduction in depressive symptoms, improvement in global functioning, adverse effects, and longer‐term effects. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. \nMain results:\nWe included 87 studies and 5964 participants in quantitative analyses. Compared with waitlist/no treatment, CBT probably increases post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety diagnoses (CBT: 49.4%, waitlist/no treatment: 17.8%; OR 5.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.90 to 7.60; n = 2697, 39 studies, moderate quality); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2.25 to 3.57) and all anxiety diagnoses (OR 4.43, 95% CI 2.89 to 6.78; n = 2075, 28 studies, moderate quality). Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference between CBT and TAU in post‐treatment primary anxiety disorder remission (OR 3.19, 95% CI 0.90 to 11.29; n = 487, 8 studies), but did suggest CBT may increase remission from all anxiety disorders compared to TAU (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.16 to 6.46; n = 203, 5 studies). Compared with attention control, CBT may increase post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.89; n = 822, 10 studies, low quality) and all anxiety disorders (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.17; n = 378, 5 studies, low quality). There was insufficient available data to compare CBT to alternative treatments on post‐treatment remission of primary anxiety disorders, and low‐quality evidence showed there may be little to no difference between these groups on post‐treatment remission of all anxiety disorders (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23; n = 401, 4 studies) Low‐quality evidence did not show a difference for acceptability between CBT and waitlist/no treatment (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.41; n=3158, 45 studies), treatment as usual (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.56; n = 441, 8 studies), attention control (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.49; n = 797, 12 studies) and alternative treatment (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.13; n=515, 7 studies). No adverse effects were reported across all studies; however, in the small number of studies where any reference was made to adverse effects, it was not clear that these were systematically monitored. Results from the anxiety symptom outcomes, broader outcomes, longer‐term outcomes and subgroup analyses are provided in the text. We did not find evidence of consistent differences in outcomes according to delivery formats (e.g. individual versus group; amount of therapist contact time) or amongst samples with and without ASD, and no studies included samples of children with intellectual impairments. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nCBT is probably more effective in the short‐term than waiting lists/no treatment, and may be more effective than attention control. We found little to no evidence across outcomes that CBT is superior to usual care or alternative treatments, but our confidence in these findings are limited due to concerns about the amount and quality of available evidence, and we still know little about how best to efficiently improve outcomes.",
    "reference_answer": "To generate a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings based on the abstract provided, I will structure the scoring criteria into clear bullet points, each representing one essential criterion related to the efficacy and acceptability of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents:\n\n- **Post-Treatment Remission:**\n  - **Primary Anxiety Diagnoses:**\n    - CBT significantly increases remission compared to waitlist/no treatment (49.4% vs. 17.8%; OR 5.45).\n    - CBT may increase remission compared to attention control (OR 2.28).\n    - Insufficient data for comparison with alternative treatments.\n    - No significant difference between CBT and treatment as usual (TAU).\n\n  - **All Anxiety Diagnoses:**\n    - CBT probably increases remission compared to waitlist/no treatment (OR 4.43).\n    - CBT may increase remission compared to TAU (OR 2.74).\n    - CBT may increase remission compared to attention control (OR 2.75).\n    - No significant difference with alternative treatments (OR 0.89).\n\n- **Acceptability (Loss to Post-Treatment Assessment):**\n  - No significant difference in acceptability between CBT and:\n    - Waitlist/no treatment (OR 1.09).\n    - TAU (OR 1.37).\n    - Attention control (OR 1.00).\n    - Alternative treatment (OR 1.58).\n\n- **Adverse Effects Monitoring:**\n  - No adverse effects were systematically reported across studies.\n  - Limited reference to adverse effects lacks systematic monitoring.\n\n- **Subgroup Analyses:**\n  - No consistent differences based on delivery format (e.g., individual vs. group, therapist contact time).\n  - Insufficient data on effects among children with ASD or intellectual impairments.\n\n- **Overall Efficacy and Evidence Quality:**\n  - CBT is likely more effective in the short-term than waitlist/no treatment.\n  - Confidence in findings related to superiority over TAU and alternative treatments is low due to limited and low-quality evidence.\n  - Further research needed to improve understanding and efficacy of CBT across diverse outcomes and subgroups.\n\nThese bullet points organize the key findings into specific criteria to assess the relative efficacy and acceptability of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents."

    "query": "Title: Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nSleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant carer distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Although non‐drug interventions are recommended as the first‐line approach to managing these problems, drug treatment is often sought and used. However, there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this clinically vulnerable population. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 19 February 2020, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest‐activity, and sundowning. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results. We used the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesised results using a fixed‐effect model. Key outcomes to be included in our summary tables were chosen with the help of a panel of carers. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence. \nMain results:\nWe found nine eligible RCTs investigating: melatonin (5 studies, n = 222, five studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta‐analysis), the sedative antidepressant trazodone (1 study, n = 30), the melatonin‐receptor agonist ramelteon (1 study, n = 74, no peer‐reviewed publication), and the orexin antagonists suvorexant and lemborexant (2 studies, n = 323). Participants in the trazodone study and most participants in the melatonin studies had moderate‐to‐severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study and the orexin antagonist studies had mild‐to‐moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. Primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy or polysomnography. In one study, melatonin treatment was combined with light therapy. Only four studies systematically assessed adverse effects. Overall, we considered the studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. We found low‐certainty evidence that melatonin doses up to 10 mg may have little or no effect on any major sleep outcome over eight to 10 weeks in people with AD and sleep disturbances. We could synthesise data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (TNST) (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI –16.22 to 37.59; 2 studies, n = 184), and the ratio of day‐time to night‐time sleep (MD –0.13, 95% CI –0.29 to 0.03; 2 studies; n = 184). From single studies, we found no evidence of an effect of melatonin on sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, number of night‐time awakenings, or mean duration of sleep bouts. There were no serious adverse effects of melatonin reported. We found low‐certainty evidence that trazodone 50 mg for two weeks may improve TNST (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; 1 study, n = 30), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; 1 study, n = 30) in people with moderate‐to‐severe AD. The effect on time awake after sleep onset was uncertain due to very serious imprecision (MD –20.41 minutes, 95% CI –60.4 to 19.6; 1 study, n = 30). There may be little or no effect on number of night‐time awakenings (MD –3.71, 95% CI –8.2 to 0.8; 1 study, n = 30) or time asleep in the day (MD 5.12 minutes, 95% CI –28.2 to 38.4). There were no serious adverse effects of trazodone reported. The small (n = 74), phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg was reported only in summary form on the sponsor's website. We considered the certainty of the evidence to be low. There was no evidence of any important effect of ramelteon on any nocturnal sleep outcomes. There were no serious adverse effects. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that an orexin antagonist taken for four weeks by people with mild‐to‐moderate AD probably increases TNST (MD 28.2 minutes, 95% CI 11.1 to 45.3; 1 study, n = 274) and decreases time awake after sleep onset (MD –15.7 minutes, 95% CI –28.1 to –3.3: 1 study, n = 274) but has little or no effect on number of awakenings (MD 0.0, 95% CI –0.5 to 0.5; 1 study, n = 274). It may be associated with a small increase in sleep efficiency (MD 4.26%, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.26; 2 studies, n = 312), has no clear effect on sleep latency (MD –12.1 minutes, 95% CI –25.9 to 1.7; 1 study, n = 274), and may have little or no effect on the mean duration of sleep bouts (MD –2.42 minutes, 95% CI –5.53 to 0.7; 1 study, n = 38). Adverse events were probably no more common among participants taking orexin antagonists than those taking placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.99; 2 studies, n = 323). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe discovered a distinct lack of evidence to guide decisions about drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many widely prescribed drugs, including the benzodiazepine and non‐benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks for these common treatments. We found no evidence for beneficial effects of melatonin (up to 10 mg) or a melatonin receptor agonist. There was evidence of some beneficial effects on sleep outcomes from trazodone and orexin antagonists and no evidence of harmful effects in these small trials, although larger trials in a broader range of participants are needed to allow more definitive conclusions to be reached. Systematic assessment of adverse effects in future trials is essential.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the analysis of the abstract, I will provide a structured set of scoring reference points to evaluate the main findings related to the pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia. Each key finding will be encapsulated as a scoring criterion:\n\n- **Scoring Criterion 1: Melatonin Efficacy**\n  - Score high if there is use of melatonin showing significant improvement in total nocturnal sleep time (TNST) over a set duration (e.g., 8-10 weeks).\n  - Score medium if there is evidence of minor improvement or maintenance in TNST or sleep efficiency.\n  - Score low if melatonin shows little or no effect on sleep outcomes with low certainty of evidence.\n\n- **Scoring Criterion 2: Trazodone Effectiveness**\n  - Score high if trazodone demonstrates significant improvement in TNST and sleep efficiency in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases.\n  - Score medium if trazodone shows some improvement in sleep quality with unclear effects on aspects such as time awake after sleep onset.\n  - Score low if trazodone shows negligible effects with uncertainties in its impact on various sleep measures.\n\n- **Scoring Criterion 3: Ramelteon Impact**\n  - Score high if ramelteon shows substantial evidence of improvement across key sleep outcomes.\n  - Score medium if there are some positive data regarding sleep enhancement but with limited evidence.\n  - Score low if ramelteon shows no noticeable effect on sleep outcomes with low certainty evidence.\n\n- **Scoring Criterion 4: Orexin Antagonists**\n  - Score high if orexin antagonists show a marked increase in TNST and reduction in wake after sleep onset.\n  - Score medium if there are some favorable outcomes on sleep efficiency and minimal adverse effects.\n  - Score low if orexin antagonists show minimal impact on sleep outcomes and report similar adverse event rates to placebo.\n\n- **Scoring Criterion 5: Adverse Effects**\n  - Score high if all studied drugs report no serious adverse effects and have a systematic assessment of side effects.\n  - Score medium if there is relatively low certainty of no severe adverse effects or if reporting lacks comprehensiveness.\n  - Score low if any drug shows potential harmful effects irrespective of improvements in sleep.\n\n- **Scoring Criterion 6: Evidence Certainty**\n  - Score high for drugs with robust evidence and clear effects from well-conducted RCTs with substantial participant numbers.\n  - Score medium for drugs with low to moderate evidence certainty or smaller study sizes.\n  - Score low for drugs lacking conclusive evidence or if current studies exhibit high risk of bias.\n\nThese scoring criteria collectively aim to capture the efficacy, safety, and evidence certainty associated with pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbances in dementia, guiding decisions and future research directions."

    "query": "Title: Specialised early intervention teams for recent‐onset psychosis\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPsychosis is an illness characterised by the presence of hallucinations and delusions that can cause distress or a marked change in an individual's behaviour (e.g. social withdrawal, flat or blunted affect). A first episode of psychosis (FEP) is the first time someone experiences these symptoms that can occur at any age, but the condition is most common in late adolescence and early adulthood. This review is concerned with first episode psychosis (FEP) and the early stages of a psychosis, referred to throughout this review as 'recent‐onset psychosis.' Specialised early intervention (SEI) teams are community mental health teams that specifically treat people who are experiencing, or have experienced a recent‐onset psychosis. The purpose of SEI teams is to intensively treat people with psychosis early in the course of the illness with the goal of increasing the likelihood of recovery and reducing the need for longer‐term mental health treatment. SEI teams provide a range of treatments including medication, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, and occupational, educational and employment support, augmented by assertive contact with the service user and small caseloads. Treatment is time limited, usually offered for two to three years, after which service users are either discharged to primary care or transferred to a standard adult community mental health team. A previous Cochrane Review of SEI found preliminary evidence that SEI may be superior to standard community mental health care (described as 'treatment as usual (TAU)' in this review) but these recommendations were based on data from only one trial. This review updates the evidence for the use of SEI services. \nObjectives:\nTo compare specialised early intervention (SEI) teams to treatment as usual (TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis. \nSearch methods:\nOn 3 October 2018 and 22 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based register of trials, including registries of clinical trials. \nSelection criteria:\nWe selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SEI with TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis. We entered trials meeting these criteria and reporting useable data as included studies. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and their 95% CIs, or if assessment measures differed for the same construct, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included three RCTs and one cluster‐RCT with a total of 1145 participants. The mean age in the trials was between 23.1 years (RAISE) and 26.6 years (OPUS). The included participants were 405 females (35.4%) and 740 males (64.6%). All trials took place in community mental healthcare settings. Two trials reported on recovery from psychosis at the end of treatment, with evidence that SEI team care may result in more participants in recovery than TAU at the end of treatment (73% versus 52%; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.97; 2 studies, 194 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Three trials provided data on disengagement from services at the end of treatment, with fewer participants probably being disengaged from mental health services in SEI (8%) in comparison to TAU (15%) (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.79; 3 studies, 630 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was low‐certainty evidence that SEI may result in fewer admissions to psychiatric hospital than TAU at the end of treatment (52% versus 57%; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00; 4 studies, 1145 participants) and low‐certainty evidence that SEI may result in fewer psychiatric hospital days (MD ‐27.00 days, 95% CI ‐53.68 to ‐0.32; 1 study, 547 participants). Two trials reported on general psychotic symptoms at the end of treatment, with no evidence of a difference between SEI and TAU, although this evidence is very uncertain (SMD ‐0.41, 95% CI ‐4.58 to 3.75; 2 studies, 304 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). A different pattern was observed in assessment of general functioning with an end of trial difference that may favour SEI (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.66; 2 studies, 467 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether the use of SEI resulted in fewer deaths due to all‐cause mortality at end of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.20; 3 studies, 741 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was low risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment in three of the four included trials; the remaining trial had unclear risk of bias. Due to the nature of the intervention, we considered all trials at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. Two trials had low risk of bias and two trials had high risk of bias for blinding of outcomes assessments. Three trials had low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data, while one trial had high risk of bias. Two trials had low risk of bias, one trial had high risk of bias, and one had unclear risk of bias for selective reporting. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is evidence that SEI may provide benefits to service users during treatment compared to TAU. These benefits probably include fewer disengagements from mental health services (moderate‐certainty evidence), and may include small reductions in psychiatric hospitalisation (low‐certainty evidence), and a small increase in global functioning (low‐certainty evidence) and increased service satisfaction (moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence regarding the effect of SEI over TAU after treatment has ended is uncertain. Further evidence investigating the longer‐term outcomes of SEI is needed. Furthermore, all the eligible trials included in this review were conducted in high‐income countries, and it is unclear whether these findings would translate to low‐ and middle‐income countries, where both the intervention and the comparison conditions may be different.",
    "reference_answer": "Here is a complete set of scoring reference points derived from the main findings of the abstract on specialised early intervention teams for recent-onset psychosis:\n\n- **Recovery from Psychosis:**\n  - SEI may increase recovery rates at the end of treatment compared to TAU (73% vs. 52%) based on low-certainty evidence.\n  \n- **Disengagement from Services:**\n  - Fewer participants are likely disengaged from mental health services in SEI (8%) compared to TAU (15%) with moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Psychiatric Hospitalisation:**\n  - SEI might result in fewer admissions to psychiatric hospitals and fewer psychiatric hospital days at the end of treatment, supported by low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **General Psychotic Symptoms:**\n  - No significant difference was observed between SEI and TAU in terms of general psychotic symptoms, with very low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **General Functioning:**\n  - There might be a small improvement in general functioning for participants receiving SEI, based on low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **All-Cause Mortality:**\n  - The effect of SEI on reducing deaths from all causes at the end of treatment remains uncertain, with low-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Service Satisfaction:**\n  - Likely increased service satisfaction for SEI participants compared to TAU (moderate-certainty evidence).\n\n- **Longer-Term Outcomes:**\n  - The effect of SEI over TAU after treatment has ended is uncertain and requires further investigation.\n\n- **Applicability to Diverse Settings:**\n  - The evidence from the included trials, conducted in high-income countries, may not necessarily apply to low- and middle-income countries where intervention conditions may differ.\n\nEach point specifies the evidence level and the focus of the criterion, maintaining a clear and structured format for clinical decision-making and evaluation."

Evidence suggests that once SEI treatment ends, improvements may not be sustained, bringing uncertainty about the optimal duration of SEI to ensure the best long‐term outcomes. Extending SEI has been proposed as a way of providing continued intensive treatment and continuity of care, of usually up to five years, in order to a) sustain the positive initial outcomes of SEI; and b) improve the long‐term trajectory of the illness. \nObjectives:\nTo compare extended SEI teams with treatment as usual (TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis. To compare extended SEI teams with standard SEI teams followed by TAU (standard SEI + TAU) for people with recent‐onset psychosis. \nSearch methods:\nOn 3 October 2018 and 22 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study‐based register of trials, including registries of clinical trials. \nSelection criteria:\nWe selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing extended SEI with TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis and all RCTs comparing extended SEI with standard SEI + TAU for people with recent‐onset psychosis.

All three trials randomly allocated people approximately two years into standard SEI to either extended SEI or standard SEI + TAU. The certainty of evidence for outcomes varied from low to very low. Our primary outcomes were recovery and disengagement from mental health services. No trials reported on recovery, and we used remission as a proxy. Three trials reported on remission, with the point estimate suggesting a 13% increase in remission in favour of extended SEI, but this included wide confidence intervals (CIs) and a very uncertain estimate of no benefit (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31; 3 trials, 780 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Two trials provided data on disengagement from services with evidence that extended SEI care may result in fewer disengagements from mental health treatment (15%) in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (34%) (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75; 2 trials, 380 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference in rates of psychiatric hospital admission (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.52; 1 trial, 160 participants; low‐certainty evidence), or the number of days spent in a psychiatric hospital (MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐8.30 to 2.90; 1 trial, 400 participants; low‐certainty evidence). One trial found uncertain evidence regarding lower global psychotic symptoms in extended SEI in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (MD ‐1.90, 95% CI ‐3.28 to ‐0.52; 1 trial, 156 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether the use of extended SEI over standard SEI + TAU resulted in fewer deaths due to all‐cause mortality, as so few deaths were recorded in trials (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64; 3 trials, 780 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Very uncertain evidence suggests that using extended SEI instead of standard SEI + TAU may not improve global functioning (SMD 0.23, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.76; 2 trials, 560 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There was low risk of bias in all three trials for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and other biases. All three trials had high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of the intervention. For the risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessments and incomplete outcome data there was at least one trial with high or unclear risk of bias. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere may be preliminary evidence of benefit from extending SEI team care for treating people experiencing psychosis, with fewer people disengaging from mental health services. Evidence regarding other outcomes was uncertain. The certainty of evidence for the measured outcomes was low or very low. Further, suitably powered studies that use a consistent approach to outcome selection are needed, but with only one further ongoing trial, there is unlikely to be any definitive conclusion for the effectiveness of extended SEI for at least the next few years.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the full-score version of the main findings, here is a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings structured in bullet points:\n\n- **Disengagement from Mental Health Services:**\n  - Extended SEI is linked to a reduced rate of disengagement compared to standard SEI + TAU (15% vs. 34%). \n  - Evidence reliability classified as low-certainty due to methodological constraints and potential biases.\n\n- **Remission Rates:**\n  - Extended SEI suggests a possible 13% increase in remission rates. \n  - This finding is based on very low-certainty evidence, constrained by wide confidence intervals.\n\n- **Psychiatric Hospital Admissions and Duration:**\n  - No significant difference observed in hospital admission rates or days spent hospitalized. \n  - Evidence for these outcomes is characterized by low-certainty.\n\n- **Global Psychotic Symptoms:**\n  - Inconclusive evidence for improvement in global psychotic symptoms with extended SEI. \n  - Very low-certainty evidence limits the conclusiveness of this finding.\n\n- **All-Cause Mortality:**\n  - Insufficient data to demonstrate a notable impact on all-cause mortality. \n  - Evidence is highly uncertain due to the rarity of outcomes across trials.\n\n- **Global Functioning:**\n  - No significant differences detected in global functioning between extended SEI and standard SEI + TAU. \n  - The evidence base for this aspect is very low-certainty.\n\n- **Risk of Bias Considerations:**\n  - Low risk of bias in random sequence generation and allocation concealment. \n  - High risk of bias noted for blinding of participants and outcome assessments.\n  - Discrepancies in outcome data contribute to the overall uncertainty in evidence.\n\n- **Overall Evidence Assessment:**\n  - The overall certainty of evidence across measured outcomes is low to very low.\n  - Further research with consistent outcome selection and larger sample sizes is necessary to draw definitive conclusions.\n"

    "query": "Title: Interventions to improve return to work in depressed people\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nWork disability such as sickness absence is common in people with depression. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing work disability in employees with depressive disorders. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO until April 4th 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs of work‐directed and clinical interventions for depressed people that included sickness absence days or being off work as an outcome. We also analysed the effects on depression and work functioning. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently extracted the data and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to pool study results in studies we judged to be sufficiently similar.  \nMain results:\nIn this update, we added 23 new studies. In total, we included 45 studies with 88 study arms, involving 12,109 participants with either a major depressive disorder or a high level of depressive symptoms. Risk of bias The most common types of bias risk were detection bias (27 studies) and attrition bias (22 studies), both for the outcome of sickness absence. Work‐directed interventions Work‐directed interventions   combined with clinical interventions A combination of a work‐directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces sickness absence days within the first year of follow‐up (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.38 to ‐0.12; 9 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). This translates back to 0.5 fewer (95% CI ‐0.7 to ‐0.2) sick leave days in the past two weeks or 25 fewer days during one year (95% CI ‐37.5 to ‐11.8). The intervention does not lead to fewer persons being off work beyond one year follow‐up (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.83; 2 studies, high‐certainty evidence). The intervention may reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.01; 8 studies, low‐certainty evidence) and probably has a small effect on work functioning (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.06; 5 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up.  Stand alone work‐directed interventions A specific work‐directed intervention alone may increase the number of sickness absence days compared with work‐directed care as usual (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; 2 studies, low‐certainty evidence) but probably does not lead to more people being off work within the first year of follow‐up (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11; 1 study, moderate‐certainty evidence) or beyond (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 2 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). There is probably no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.10, 95% ‐0.30 CI to 0.10; 4 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up and there may be no effect on depressive symptoms beyond that time (SMD 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.49; 1 study, low‐certainty evidence). The intervention may also not lead to better work functioning (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.90 to 0.26; 1 study, low‐certainty evidence) within the first year of follow‐up.   Psychological interventions A psychological intervention, either face‐to���face, or an E‐mental health intervention, with or without professional guidance, may reduce the number of sickness absence days, compared with care as usual (SMD ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.28 to ‐0.03; 9 studies, low‐certainty evidence). It may also reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐0.45 to ‐0.15, 8 studies, low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether these psychological interventions improve work ability (SMD ‐0.15 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.57; 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Psychological intervention   combined with antidepressant medication Two studies compared the effect of a psychological intervention combined with antidepressants to antidepressants alone. One study combined psychodynamic therapy with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) medication and another combined telephone‐administered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We are uncertain if this intervention reduces the number of sickness absence days (SMD ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.99 to 0.24; 2 studies, very low‐certainty evidence) but found that there may be no effect on depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.50 to 0.12; 2 studies, low‐certainty evidence). Antidepressant medication only Three studies compared the effectiveness of SSRI to selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medication on reducing sickness absence and yielded highly inconsistent results. Improved care Overall, interventions to improve care did not lead to fewer sickness absence days, compared to care as usual (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.06; 7 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). However, in studies with a low risk of bias, the intervention probably leads to fewer sickness absence days in the first year of follow‐up (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.05; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Improved care probably leads to fewer depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.07; 7 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence) but may possibly lead to a decrease in work‐functioning (SMD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; 1 study; moderate‐certainty evidence). Exercise Supervised strength exercise may reduce sickness absence, compared to relaxation (SMD ‐1.11; 95% CI ‐1.68 to ‐0.54; one study, low‐certainty evidence). However, aerobic exercise probably is not more effective than relaxation or stretching (SMD ‐0.06; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.24; 2 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence). Both studies found no differences between the two conditions in depressive symptoms. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nA combination of a work‐directed intervention and a clinical intervention probably reduces the number of sickness absence days, but at the end of one year or longer follow‐up, this does not lead to more people in the intervention group being at work. The intervention may also reduce depressive symptoms and probably increases work functioning more than care as usual. Specific work‐directed interventions may not be more effective than usual work‐directed care alone. Psychological interventions may reduce the number of sickness absence days, compared with care as usual. Interventions to improve clinical care probably lead to lower sickness absence and lower levels of depression, compared with care as usual. There was no evidence of a difference in effect on sickness absence of one antidepressant medication compared to another. Further research is needed to assess which combination of work‐directed and clinical interventions works best.",

    "query": "Title: Means restriction for the prevention of suicide on roads\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nRoad traffic suicides are common. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing between motor vehicle crash fatalities and actual suicides, no official figures exist for this method of suicide. Restricting access to means is an important universal or population‐based approach to suicide prevention with clear evidence of its effectiveness. However, the evidence with respect to means restriction for the prevention of suicide on roads is not well established. We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of restrictions on the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Transport Research International Documentation (TRID) Database from the date of database inception to March 2020. We conducted searches of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. We applied no date, language, or publication status restrictions to these searches. \nSelection criteria:\nEligible studies were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials, controlled intervention studies without randomisation, before‐after studies, or studies using interrupted time series designs, which evaluated interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide on roads. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors screened abstracts and full‐text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors planned to independently extract data and assess risk of bias of included studies. However, we identified no studies eligible for inclusion. \nMain results:\nWe identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis systematic review highlights the paucity of research around road traffic suicides and the need for future robust studies that aim to investigate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent suicide on roads. Suicide ascertainment is a key issue; therefore, clear objective criteria are necessary in order to scale up and study this method more accurately. In the absence of any substantial evidence, we advocate for more awareness on road traffic suicides and its inclusion in future government suicide prevention policies. Further research exploring effective measures, particularly those that do not require driver compliance, are also needed.",

    "query": "Title: Psychological and social interventions for the prevention of mental disorders in people living in low‐ and middle‐income countries affected by humanitarian crises\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPeople living in 'humanitarian settings' in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) are exposed to a constellation of physical and psychological stressors that make them vulnerable to developing mental disorders. A range of psychological and social interventions have been implemented with the aim to prevent the onset of mental disorders and/or lower psychological distress in populations at risk, and it is not known whether interventions are effective. \nObjectives:\nTo compare the efficacy and acceptability of psychological and social interventions versus control conditions (wait list, treatment as usual, attention placebo, psychological placebo, or no treatment) aimed at preventing the onset of non‐psychotic mental disorders in people living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR), the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Review Group (CDAG) Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), and ProQuest PILOTS database with results incorporated from searches to February 2020. We also searched the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished or ongoing studies. We checked the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological and social interventions versus control conditions to prevent the onset of mental disorders in adults and children living in LMICs affected by humanitarian crises. We excluded studies that enrolled participants based on a positive diagnosis of mental disorder (or based on a proxy of scoring above a cut‐off score on a screening measure). \nData collection and analysis:\nWe calculated standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous data, using a random‐effects model. We analysed data at endpoint (zero to four weeks after therapy) and at medium term (one to four months after intervention). No data were available at long term (six months or longer). We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. \nMain results:\nIn the present review we included seven RCTs with a total of 2398 participants, coming from both children/adolescents (five RCTs), and adults (two RCTs). Together, the seven RCTs compared six different psychosocial interventions against a control comparator (waiting list in all studies). All the interventions were delivered by paraprofessionals and, with the exception of one study, delivered at a group level. None of the included studies provided data on the efficacy of interventions to prevent the onset of mental disorders (incidence). For the primary outcome of acceptability, there may be no evidence of a difference between psychological and social interventions and control at endpoint for children and adolescents (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10; 5 studies, 1372 participants; low‐quality evidence) or adults (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.50; 2 studies, 767 participants; very low quality evidence). No information on adverse events related to the interventions was available. For children's and adolescents' secondary outcomes of prevention interventions, there may be no evidence of a difference between psychological and social intervention groups and control groups for reducing PTSD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.16, 95% CI −0.50 to 0.18; 3 studies, 590 participants; very low quality evidence), depressive symptoms (SMD −0.01, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.31; 4 RCTs, 746 participants; very low quality evidence) and anxiety symptoms (SMD 0.11, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.31; 3 studies, 632 participants; very low quality evidence) at study endpoint. In adults' secondary outcomes of prevention interventions, psychological counselling may be effective for reducing depressive symptoms (MD −7.50, 95% CI −9.19 to −5.81; 1 study, 258 participants; very low quality evidence) and anxiety symptoms (MD −6.10, 95% CI −7.57 to −4.63; 1 study, 258 participants; very low quality evidence) at endpoint. No data were available for PTSD symptoms in the adult population. Owing to the small number of RCTs included in the present review, it was not possible to carry out neither sensitivity nor subgroup analyses. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOf the seven prevention studies included in this review, none assessed whether prevention interventions reduced the incidence of mental disorders and there may be no evidence for any differences in acceptability. Additionally, for both child and adolescent populations and adult populations, a very small number of RCTs with low quality evidence on the review's secondary outcomes (changes in symptomatology at endpoint) did not suggest any beneficial effect for the studied prevention interventions. Confidence in the findings is hampered by the scarcity of prevention studies eligible for inclusion in the review, by risk of bias in the studies, and by substantial levels of heterogeneity. Moreover, it is possible that random error had a role in distorting results, and that a more thorough picture of the efficacy of prevention interventions will be provided by future studies. For this reason, prevention studies are urgently needed to assess the impact of interventions on the incidence of mental disorders in children and adults, with extended periods of follow‐up.",

Activities tailored to their individual interests and preferences might be one approach to improve quality of life and reduce challenging behaviour. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of personally tailored activities on psychosocial outcomes for people with dementia living in the community and their caregivers. To describe the components of the interventions. To describe conditions which enhance the effectiveness of personally tailored activities in this setting. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 11 September 2019 using the terms: activity OR activities OR occupation* OR “psychosocial intervention\" OR \"non‐pharmacological intervention\" OR \"personally‐tailored\" OR \"individually‐tailored\" OR individual OR meaning OR involvement OR engagement OR occupational OR personhood OR \"person‐centred\" OR identity OR Montessori OR community OR ambulatory OR \"home care\" OR \"geriatric day hospital\" OR \"day care\" OR \"behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia\" OR \"BPSD\" OR \"neuropsychiatric symptoms\" OR \"challenging behaviour\" OR \"quality of life\" OR depression. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials and quasi‐experimental trials including a control group offering personally tailored activities. All interventions comprised an assessment of the participant’s present or past interests in, or preferences for, particular activities for all participants as a basis for an individual activity plan. We did not include interventions offering a single activity (e.g. music or reminiscence) or activities that were not tailored to the individual's interests or preferences. Control groups received usual care or an active control intervention. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently checked the articles for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of all included studies. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias. In case of missing information, we contacted the study authors. \nMain results:\nWe included five randomised controlled trials (four parallel‐group studies and one cross‐over study), in which a total of 262 participants completed the studies. The number of participants ranged from 30 to 160. The mean age of the participants ranged from 71 to 83 years, and mean Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ranged from 11 to 24. One study enrolled predominantly male veterans; in the other studies the proportion of female participants ranged from 40% to 60%. Informal caregivers were mainly spouses. In four studies family caregivers were trained to deliver personally tailored activities based on an individual assessment of interests and preferences of the people with dementia, and in one study such activities were offered directly to the participants. The selection of activities was performed with different methods. Two studies compared personally tailored activities with an attention control group, and three studies with usual care. Duration of follow‐up ranged from two weeks to four months. We found low‐certainty evidence indicating that personally tailored activities may reduce challenging behaviour (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.77 to −0.10; I 2  = 44%; 4 studies; 305 participants) and may slightly improve quality of life (based on the rating of family caregivers). For the secondary outcomes depression (two studies), affect (one study), passivity (one study), and engagement (two studies), we found low‐certainty evidence that personally tailored activities may have little or no effect. We found low‐certainty evidence that personally tailored activities may slightly improve caregiver distress (two studies) and may have little or no effect on caregiver burden (MD −0.62, 95% CI −3.08 to 1.83; I 2  = 0%; 3 studies; 246 participants), caregivers' quality of life, and caregiver depression. None of the studies assessed adverse effects, and no information about adverse effects was reported in any study. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOffering personally tailored activities to people with dementia living in the community may be one approach for reducing challenging behaviour and may also slightly improve the quality of life of people with dementia. Given the low certainty of the evidence, these results should be interpreted with caution. For depression and affect of people with dementia, as well as caregivers' quality of life and burden, we found no clear benefits of personally tailored activities.",

    "query": "Title: Aromatherapy for dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMedications licensed for the treatment of dementia have limited efficacy against cognitive impairment or against the distressed behaviours (behavioural and psychological symptoms, or behaviour that challenges) which are also often the most distressing aspect of the disorder for caregivers. Complementary therapies, including aromatherapy, are attractive to patients, practitioners and families, because they are perceived as being unlikely to cause adverse effects. Therefore there is interest in whether aromatherapy might offer a safe means of alleviating distressed behaviours in dementia. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of aromatherapy for people with dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 5 May 2020 using the terms: aromatherapy, lemon, lavender, rose, aroma, alternative therapies, complementary therapies, essential oils. In addition, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (all via Ovid SP), Web of Science Core Collection (via Thompson Web of Science), LILACS (via BIREME), CENTRAL (via the Cochrane Library), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) on 5 May 2020. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials which compared fragrance from plants in an intervention defined as aromatherapy for people with dementia with placebo aromatherapy or with treatment as usual. All doses, frequencies and fragrances of aromatherapy were considered. Participants in the included studies had a diagnosis of dementia of any subtype and severity. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies, involving other authors to reach consensus decisions where necessary. We did not perform any meta‐analyses because of heterogeneity between studies, but presented a narrative synthesis of results from the included trials. Because of the heterogeneity of analysis methods and inadequate or absent reporting of data from some trials, we used statistical significance (P ≤ or > 0.5) as a summary metric when synthesising results across studies. As far as possible, we used GRADE methods to assess our confidence in the results of the trials, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision. \nMain results:\nWe included 13 studies with 708 participants. All participants had dementia and in the 12 trials which described the setting, all were resident in institutional care facilities. Nine trials recruited participants because they had significant agitation or other behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) at baseline. The fragrances used were lavender (eight studies); lemon balm (four studies); lavender and lemon balm, lavender and orange, and cedar extracts (one study each). For six trials, assessment of risk of bias and extraction of results was hampered by poor reporting. Four of the other seven trials were at low risk of bias in all domains, but all were small (range 18 to 186 participants; median 66), reducing our confidence in the results. Our primary outcomes were agitation, overall behavioural and psychological symptoms, and adverse effects. Ten trials assessed agitation using various scales. Among the five trials for which our confidence in the results was moderate or low, four trials reported no significant effect on agitation and one trial reported a significant benefit of aromatherapy. The other five trials either reported no useable data or our confidence in the results was very low. Eight trials assessed overall BPSD using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and we had moderate or low confidence in the results of five of them. Of these, four reported significant benefit from aromatherapy and one reported no significant effect. Adverse events were poorly reported or not reported at all in most trials. No more than two trials assessed each of our secondary outcomes of quality of life, mood, sleep, activities of daily living, caregiver burden. We did not find evidence of benefit on these outcomes. Three trials assessed cognition: one did not report any data and the other two trials reported no significant effect of aromatherapy on cognition. Our confidence in the results of these studies was low. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe have not found any convincing evidence that aromatherapy (or exposure to fragrant plant oils) is beneficial for people with dementia although there are many limitations to the data. Conduct or reporting problems in half of the included studies meant that they could not contribute to the conclusions. Results from the other studies were inconsistent. Harms were very poorly reported in the included studies. In order for clear conclusions to be drawn, better design and reporting and consistency of outcome measurement in future trials would be needed.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Effectiveness on Agitation and BPSD:**\n  - Evidence for aromatherapy's effectiveness in reducing agitation and BPSD is inconsistent.\n  - Some studies showed significant benefits, while others showed no effect on agitation and BPSD.\n  - Our confidence in the results is moderate or low; inconsistencies and low-quality evidence affect reliability.\n\n- **Adverse Events Reporting:**\n  - Adverse events were poorly reported or not reported at all in most trials.\n  - Lack of comprehensive reporting on adverse events limits the safety evaluation of aromatherapy.\n\n- **Secondary Outcomes:**\n  - No evidence of benefit was found in secondary outcomes such as quality of life, mood, sleep, activities of daily living, caregiver burden, and cognition.\n  - Very few trials assessed these secondary outcomes, affecting the confidence in any potential benefits for these areas.\n\n- **Study Quality and Reporting:**\n  - Study quality varied greatly, with many trials exhibiting design and reporting problems.\n  - Small sample sizes in many trials reduce the robustness of the data and results.\n  - Properly designed future trials with consistent outcome measurements are needed for clear conclusions.\n\n- **Inclusion and Fragrance Variety:**\n  - Included 13 studies with a total of 708 participants, all with dementia.\n  - Fragrances used in the trials included lavender, lemon balm, and others.\n\n- **Conclusive Evidence:**\n  - Currently, there is no convincing evidence that aromatherapy is beneficial for people with dementia.\n  - Half of the included studies could not contribute to conclusions due to conduct or reporting issues.\n  - Future research would benefit from improved reporting, study design, and consistency in outcome measurement."

    "query": "Title: Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nThe symptoms and signs of schizophrenia have been linked to high levels of dopamine in specific areas of the brain (limbic system). Antipsychotic drugs block the transmission of dopamine in the brain and reduce the acute symptoms of the disorder. An original version of the current review, published in 2012, examined whether antipsychotic drugs are also effective for relapse prevention. This is the updated version of the aforesaid review. \nObjectives:\nTo review the effects of maintaining antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia compared to withdrawing these agents. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials including the registries of clinical trials (12 November 2008, 10 October 2017, 3 July 2018, 11 September 2019). \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised trials comparing maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs and placebo for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like psychoses. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention‐to‐treat basis based on a random‐effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD), again based on a random‐effects model. \nMain results:\nThe review currently includes 75 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 9145 participants comparing antipsychotic medication with placebo. The trials were published from 1959 to 2017 and their size ranged between 14 and 420 participants. In many studies the methods of randomisation, allocation and blinding were poorly reported. However, restricting the analysis to studies at low risk of bias gave similar results. Although this and other potential sources of bias limited the overall quality, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia was clear. Antipsychotic drugs were more effective than placebo in preventing relapse at seven to 12 months (primary outcome; drug 24% versus placebo 61%, 30 RCTs, n = 4249, RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.45, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 3; high‐certainty evidence). Hospitalisation was also reduced, however, the baseline risk was lower (drug 7% versus placebo 18%, 21 RCTs, n = 3558, RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57, NNTB 8, 95% CI 6 to 14; high‐certainty evidence). More participants in the placebo group than in the antipsychotic drug group left the studies early due to any reason (at seven to 12 months: drug 36% versus placebo 62%, 24 RCTs, n = 3951, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65, NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; high‐certainty evidence) and due to inefficacy of treatment (at seven to 12 months: drug 18% versus placebo 46%, 24 RCTs, n = 3951, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.44, NNTB 3, 95% CI 3 to 4). Quality of life might be better in drug‐treated participants (7 RCTs, n = 1573 SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI to ‐0.57 to ‐0.07; low‐certainty evidence); probably the same for social functioning (15 RCTs, n = 3588, SMD ‐0.43, 95% CI ‐0.53 to ‐0.34; moderate‐certainty evidence). Underpowered data revealed no evidence of a difference between groups for the outcome ‘Death due to suicide’ (drug 0.04% versus placebo 0.1%, 19 RCTs, n = 4634, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.97,low‐certainty evidence) and for the number of participants in employment (at 9 to 15 months, drug 39% versus placebo 34%, 3 RCTs, n = 593, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.41, low certainty evidence). Antipsychotic drugs (as a group and irrespective of duration) were associated with more participants experiencing movement disorders (e.g. at least one movement disorder: drug 14% versus placebo 8%, 29 RCTs, n = 5276, RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.85, number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 20, 95% CI 14 to 50), sedation (drug 8% versus placebo 5%, 18 RCTs, n = 4078, RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.86, NNTH 50, 95% CI not significant), and weight gain (drug 9% versus placebo 6%, 19 RCTs, n = 4767, RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.35, NNTH 25, 95% CI 20 to 50). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nFor people with schizophrenia, the evidence suggests that maintenance on antipsychotic drugs prevents relapse to a much greater extent than placebo for approximately up to two years of follow‐up. This effect must be weighed against the adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs. Future studies should better clarify the long‐term morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs.",

    "query": "Title: Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults with non‐communicable diseases\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDepression is common in people with non‐communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions. The co‐existence of depression and NCDs may affect health behaviours, compliance with treatment, physiological factors, and quality of life. This in turn is associated with worse outcomes for both conditions. Behavioural activation is not currently indicated for the treatment of depression in this population in the UK, but is increasingly being used to treat depression in adults. \nObjectives:\nTo examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with any control group for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with each control group separately (no treatment, waiting list, other psychological therapy, pharmacological treatment, or any other type of treatment as usual) for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched CCMD‐CTR, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers on 4 October 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for depression in participants with NCDs, together with grey literature and reference checking. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included RCTs of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression in adults with one of four NCDs: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions. Only participants with a formal diagnosis of both depression and an NCD were eligible. Studies were included if behavioural activation was the main component of the intervention. We included studies with any comparator that was not behavioural activation, and regardless of reported outcomes. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, including independent screening of titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments in duplicate. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for more information. \nMain results:\nWe included two studies, contributing data from 181 participants to the analyses. Both studies recruited participants from US hospital clinics; one included people who were recovering from a stroke and the other women with breast cancer. For both studies, the intervention consisted of eight weeks of face‐to‐face behavioural therapy, with one study comparing to poststroke treatment as usual and the other comparing to problem‐solving therapy. Both studies were at risk of performance bias and potential conflict of interest arising from author involvement in the development of the intervention. For one study, risks of selection bias and reporting bias were unclear and the study was judged at high risk of attrition bias. Treatment efficacy (remission) was greater for behavioural activation than for comparators in the short term (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 2.38; low‐certainty evidence) and medium term (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.08; moderate‐certainty evidence), but these estimates lacked precision and effects were reduced in the long term (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.23; moderate‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability in the short term (RR 1.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.82) and medium term (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.10) (low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in depression symptoms between behavioural activation and comparators (short term: MD –1.15, 95% CI –2.71 to 0.41; low‐certainty evidence). One study found no difference for quality of life (short term: MD 0.40, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.96; low‐certainty evidence), functioning (short term: MD 2.70, 95% CI –6.99 to 12.39; low‐certainty evidence), and anxiety symptoms (short term: MD –1.70, 95% CI –4.50 to 1.10; low‐certainty evidence). Neither study reported data on adverse effects. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nEvidence from this review was not sufficient to draw conclusions on the efficacy and acceptability of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. A future review may wish to include, or focus on, studies of people with subthreshold depression or depression symptoms without a formal diagnosis, as this may inform whether behavioural activation could be used to treat mild or undiagnosed (or both) depressive symptoms in people with NCDs. Evidence from low‐resource settings including low‐ and middle‐income countries, for which behavioural activation may offer a feasible alternative to other treatments for depression, would be of interest.",

    "query": "Title: Interventions for the management of obesity in people with bipolar disorder\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nBipolar disorder is one of the most common serious mental illnesses, affecting approximately 60 million people worldwide. Characterised by extreme alterations in mood, cognition, and behaviour, bipolar disorder can have a significant negative impact on the functioning and quality of life of the affected individual. Compared with the general population, the prevalence of comorbid obesity is significantly higher in bipolar disorder. Approximately 68% of treatment seeking bipolar patients are overweight or obese. Clinicians are aware that obesity has the potential to contribute to other physical health conditions in people with bipolar disorder, including diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death in bipolar disorder, happening a decade or more earlier than in the general population. Contributing factors include illness‐related factors (mood‐related factors, i.e. mania or depression), treatment‐related factors (weight implications and other side effects of medications), and lifestyle factors (physical inactivity, poor diet, smoking, substance abuse). Approaches to the management of obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder are diverse and include non‐pharmacological interventions (i.e. dietary, exercise, behavioural, or multi‐component), pharmacological interventions (i.e. weight loss drugs or medication switching), and bariatric surgery. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness of interventions for the management of obesity in people with bipolar disorder. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to February 2019. We ran additional searches via Ovid databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo to May 2020. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also checked the reference lists of all papers brought to full‐text stage and all relevant systematic reviews. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised at the level of the individual or cluster, and cross‐over designs of interventions for management of obesity, in which at least 80% of study participants had a clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder and comorbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m²), were eligible for inclusion. No exclusions were based on type of bipolar disorder, stage of illness, age, or gender. We included non‐pharmacological interventions comprising dietary, exercise, behavioural, and multi‐component interventions; pharmacological interventions consisting of weight loss medications and medication switching interventions; and surgical interventions such as gastric bypass, gastric bands, biliopancreatic diversion, and vertical banded gastroplasty. Comparators included the following approaches: dietary intervention versus inactive comparator; exercise intervention versus inactive comparator; behavioural intervention versus inactive comparator; multi‐component lifestyle intervention versus inactive comparator; medication switching intervention versus inactive comparator; weight loss medication intervention versus inactive comparator; and surgical intervention versus inactive comparator. Primary outcomes of interest were changes in body mass, patient‐reported adverse events, and quality of life. \nData collection and analysis:\nFour review authors were involved in the process of selecting studies. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies identified in the search. Studies brought to the full‐text stage were then screened by another two review authors working independently. However, none of the full‐text studies met the inclusion criteria. Had we included studies, we would have assessed their methodological quality by using the criteria recommended in the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We intended to combine dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs), and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). For each outcome, we intended to calculate overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \nMain results:\nNone of the studies that were screened met the inclusion criteria. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nNone of the studies that were assessed met the inclusion criteria of this review. Therefore we were unable to determine the effectiveness of interventions for the management of obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder. Given the extent and impact of the problem and the absence of evidence, this review highlights the need for research in this area. We suggest the need for RCTs that will focus only on populations with bipolar disorder and comorbid obesity. We identified several ongoing studies that may be included in the update of this review.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the abstract and full-score version of the main findings provided, here is a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings of the study:\n\n- The lack of identified studies that meet the inclusion criteria highlights the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically addressing obesity management in individuals with bipolar disorder.\n- Extensive searches in multiple databases and registries, including Cochrane Central Register, MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov, yielded no studies that met the defined inclusion criteria.\n- The inability to establish the effectiveness of interventions for obesity management in bipolar disorder due to the exclusion of all screened studies based on inclusion criteria.\n- The emphasis on the necessity for future RCTs specifically targeting populations with both bipolar disorder and comorbid obesity to address the research gap.\n- Acknowledgment of ongoing studies that could potentially be included in future updates of this review, indicating a forward-looking approach to the issue.\n- The main conclusion underscores the urgent need for targeted research, making clear the extent and impact of obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder and the current lack of evidence-based interventions."

    "query": "Title: Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nBehavioural activation is a brief psychotherapeutic approach that seeks to change the way a person interacts with their environment. Behavioural activation is increasingly receiving attention as a potentially cost‐effective intervention for depression, which may require less resources and may be easier to deliver and implement than other types of psychotherapy. \nObjectives:\nTo examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with other psychological therapies for depression in adults. To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with medication for depression in adults. To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/placebo no treatment for depression in adults. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched CCMD‐CTR (all available years), CENTRAL (current issue), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards), Ovid EMBASE (1980 onwards), and Ovid PsycINFO (1806 onwards) on the 17 January 2020 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 'behavioural activation', or the main elements of behavioural activation for depression in participants with clinically diagnosed depression or subthreshold depression. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language or publication status to the searches. We searched international trials registries via the World Health Organization's trials portal ( ICTRP ) and  ClinicalTrials.gov  to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression or symptoms of depression in adults aged 18 or over. We excluded RCTs conducted in inpatient settings and with trial participants selected because of a physical comorbidity. Studies were included regardless of reported outcomes. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently screened all titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts for inclusion. Data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments were also performed by two review authors in duplicate. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for more information. \nMain results:\nFifty‐three studies with 5495 participants were included; 51 parallel group RCTs and two cluster‐RCTs. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation had greater short‐term efficacy than treatment as usual (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 1.78; 7 RCTs, 1533 participants), although this difference was no longer evident in sensitivity analyses using a worst‐case or intention‐to‐treat scenario. Compared with waiting list, behavioural activation may be more effective, but there were fewer data in this comparison and evidence was of low certainty (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.90 to 5.09; 1 RCT, 26 participants). No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for behavioural activation versus placebo and behavioural activation versus no treatment. We found moderate‐certainty evidence suggesting no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment efficacy between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07; 5 RCTs, 601 participants). Fewer data were available for other comparators. No evidence of a difference in short term‐efficacy was found between behavioural activation and third‐wave CBT (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.33; 2 RCTs, 98 participants; low certainty), and psychodynamic therapy (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.99; 1 RCT,60 participants; very low certainty). Behavioural activation was more effective than humanistic therapy (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.95; 2 RCTs, 46 participants; low certainty) and medication (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.76; 1 RCT; 141 participants; moderate certainty), but both of these results were based on a small number of trials and participants. No evidence on treatment efficacy was available for comparisons between behavioural activation versus interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapies. There was moderate‐certainty evidence that behavioural activation might have lower treatment acceptability (based on dropout rate) than treatment as usual in the short term, although the data did not confirm a difference and results lacked precision (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.31; 14 RCTs, 2518 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence did not suggest any difference in short‐term acceptability between behavioural activation and waiting list (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.93; 8 RCTs. 359 participants), no treatment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.09; 3 RCTs, 187 participants), medication (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.16; 2 RCTs, 243 participants), or placebo (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.67; 1 RCT; 96 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No evidence on treatment acceptability was available comparing behavioural activation versus psychodynamic therapy. Low‐certainty evidence did not show a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (dropout rate) between behavioural activation and CBT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25; 12 RCTs, 1195 participants), third‐wave CBT (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.10; 3 RCTs, 147 participants); humanistic therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.55; 2 RCTs, 96 participants) (very low certainty), and interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapy (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, 123 participants). Results from medium‐ and long‐term primary outcomes, secondary outcomes, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses are summarised in the text. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis systematic review suggests that behavioural activation may be more effective than humanistic therapy, medication, and treatment as usual, and that it may be no less effective than CBT, psychodynamic therapy, or being placed on a waiting list. However, our confidence in these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in short‐term treatment acceptability (based on dropouts) between behavioural activation and most comparison groups (CBT, humanistic therapy, waiting list, placebo, medication, no treatment or treatment as usual). Again, our confidence in all these findings is limited due to concerns about the certainty of the evidence. No data were available about the efficacy of behavioural activation compared with placebo, or about treatment acceptability comparing behavioural activation and psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal, cognitive analytic and integrative therapies. The evidence could be strengthened by better reporting and better quality RCTs of behavioural activation and by assessing working mechanisms of behavioural activation.",
    "reference_answer": "### Scoring Reference Points for Main Findings\n\n**Efficacy**  \n- **Greater Short-Term Efficacy Compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU):**  \n  - Behavioural activation (BA) is supported by moderate-certainty evidence showing greater efficacy than TAU in the short term.  \n  - Sensitivity analyses reveal inconsistencies in this finding, indicating that the observed efficacy may not be robust.  \n\n- **Comparison with Waiting List:**  \n  - Evidence suggests BA may be more effective than waiting list, but the certainty of this evidence is low.  \n\n- **Comparison with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Psychodynamic Therapy:**  \n  - Moderate- to low-certainty evidence indicates no difference in short-term efficacy between BA and CBT or third-wave CBT.  \n  - Very low certainty suggests no significant difference between BA and psychodynamic therapy.  \n\n- **Comparison with Humanistic Therapy and Medication:**  \n  - Moderate-certainty evidence suggests BA is more effective than humanistic therapy and medication, but findings are based on a limited number of trials and participants, thus lowering certainty.  \n\n- **Absence of Conclusive Evidence for Other Therapies:**  \n  - No conclusive evidence for BA's efficacy compared to placebo or therapies like interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapies.  \n\n**Acceptability**  \n- **General Acceptability Comparison:**  \n  - Moderate-certainty evidence indicates no significant difference in treatment acceptability (dropout rates) between BA and most comparison groups, including CBT, waiting list, placebo, medication, and no treatment.  \n\n- **Short-Term Acceptability Concerns:**  \n  - There are indications that BA might have lower treatment acceptability than TAU in the short term, though this result lacks precision and confirmatory evidence.  \n\n- **Certainty Concerns:**  \n  - Evidence certainty varies, with moderate certainty for some comparisons like TAU and low to very low certainty for others due to methodological concerns in the studies.\n\n- **Unavailable Data for Specific Comparisons:**  \n  - Lack of available evidence on treatment acceptability comparing BA with psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal, cognitive analytic, and integrative therapies.  \n\n**Recommendation for Future Research:**  \n- The need for improved reporting and higher quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to better assess the efficacy and mechanisms of behavioural activation in treating depression."

    "query": "Title: Psychological interventions for psychosis in adolescents\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPsychosis is an illness characterised by alterations in thoughts and perceptions resulting in delusions and hallucinations. Psychosis is rare in adolescents but can have serious consequences. Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay treatment, and have been shown to be effective. However, there is emerging evidence on psychological interventions such as cognitive remediation therapy, psycho‐education, family therapy and group psychotherapy that may be useful for adolescents with psychosis. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of various psychological interventions for adolescents with psychosis. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study‐based Register of Trials including clinical trials registries (latest, 8 March 2019). \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised controlled trials comparing various psychological interventions with treatment‐as‐usual or other psychological treatments for adolescents with psychosis. For analyses, we included trials meeting our inclusion criteria and reporting useable data. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently and reliably screened studies and we assessed risk of bias of the included studies. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we used mean differences (MDs) and the 95% CIs. We used a random‐effects model for analyses. We created a ‘Summary of findings' table using GRADE. \nMain results:\nThe current review includes 7 studies (n = 319) assessing a heterogenous group of psychological interventions with variable risk of bias. Adverse events were not reported by any of the studies. None of the studies was sponsored by industry. Below, we summarise the main results from four of six comparisons, and the certainty of these results (based on GRADE). All scale scores are average endpoint scores. Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) + Treatment‐as‐Usual (TAU) versus TAU Two studies compared adding CRT to participants' TAU with TAU alone. Global state (CGAS, high = good) was reported by one study. There was no clear difference between treatment groups (MD ‐4.90, 95% CI ‐11.05 to 1.25; participants = 50; studies = 1, very low‐certainty). Mental state (PANSS, high = poor) was reported by one study. Scores were clearly lower in the TAU group (MD 8.30, 95% CI 0.46 to 16.14; participants = 50; studies = 1; very low‐certainty). Clearly more participants in the CRT group showed improvement in cognitive functioning (Memory digit span test) compared to numbers showing improvement in the TAU group (1 study, n = 31, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.89; very low‐certainty). For global functioning (VABS, high = good), our analysis of reported scores showed no clear difference between treatment groups (MD 5.90, 95% CI ‐3.03 to 14.83; participants = 50; studies = 1; very low‐certainty). The number of participants leaving the study early from each group was similar (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.71; participants = 91; studies = 2; low‐certainty). Group Psychosocial Therapy (GPT) + TAU versus TAU One study assessed the effects of adding GPT to participants' usual medication. Global state scores (CGAS, high = good) were clearly higher in the GPT group (MD 5.10, 95% CI 1.35 to 8.85; participants = 56; studies = 1; very low‐certainty) but there was little or no clear difference between groups for mental state scores (PANSS, high = poor, MD ‐4.10, 95% CI ‐8.28 to 0.08; participants = 56; studies = 1, very low‐certainty) and no clear difference between groups for numbers of participants leaving the study early (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; participants = 56; studies = 1; very low‐certainty). Cognitive Remediation Programme (CRP) + Psychoeducational Treatment Programme (PTP) versus PTP One study assessed the effects of combining two types psychological interventions (CRP + PTP) with PTP alone. Global state scores (GAS, high = good) were not clearly different (MD 1.60, 95% CI ‐6.48 to 9.68; participants = 25; studies = 1; very low‐certainty), as were mental state scores (BPRS total, high = poor, MD ‐5.40, 95% CI ‐16.42 to 5.62; participants = 24; studies = 1; very low‐certainty), and cognitive functioning scores (SPAN‐12, high = good, MD 2.40, 95% CI ‐2.67 to 7.47; participants = 25; studies = 1; very low‐certainty). Psychoeducational (PE) + Multifamily Treatment (MFT) Versus Nonstructured Group Therapy ( NSGT , all long‐term) One study compared (PE + MFT) with NSGT. Analysis of reported global state scores (CGAS, high = good, MD 3.38, 95% CI ‐4.87 to 11.63; participants = 49; studies = 1; very low‐certainty) and mental state scores (PANSS total, high = poor, MD ‐8.23, 95% CI ‐17.51 to 1.05; participants = 49; studies = 1; very low‐certainty) showed no clear differences. The number of participants needing hospital admission (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.96; participants = 49; studies = 1) and the number of participants leaving the study early from each group were also similar (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.60; participants = 55; studies = 1; low‐certainty). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nMost of our estimates of effect for our main outcomes are equivocal. An effect is suggested for only four outcomes in the SOF tables presented. Compared to TAU, CRT may have a positive effect on cognitive functioning, however the same study reports data suggesting TAU may have positive effect on mental state. Another study comparing GPT with TAU reports data suggesting GPT may have a positive effect on global state. However, the estimate of effects for all the main outcomes in our review should be viewed with considerable caution as they are based on data from a small number of studies with variable risk of bias. Further data could change these results and larger and better quality studies are needed before any firm conclusions regarding the effects of psychological interventions for adolescents with psychosis can be made.",
    "reference_answer": "Here is a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings based on the provided models and the abstract's main results:\n\n- **Cognitive Functioning Improvement:**\n  - Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) combined with Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) may lead to improvements in cognitive functioning when compared to TAU alone. This is based on one study with very low certainty.\n\n- **Global State Enhancement:**\n  - Group Psychosocial Therapy (GPT) added to TAU may enhance global state scores compared to TAU alone, based on one study with very low certainty.\n\n- **Mental State Assessment:**\n  - Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) may have a beneficial effect on mental state over CRT, as suggested by one study with very low certainty.\n\n- **Equivocal Findings:**\n  - Most of the psychological interventions studied, including CRT + TAU, GPT + TAU, CRP + PTP, and PE + MFT, did not show significant differences in global state or mental state scores compared to their respective control groups, indicating mixed or inconclusive results due to very low certainty.\n\n- **No Clear Difference in Hospital Admission:**\n  - There were no clear differences in hospital admission rates between intervention groups and control groups, based on available data from very low-certainty studies.\n\n- **Research Limitations:**\n  - Conclusions are drawn from a limited number of studies with variable risk of bias, which necessitates cautious interpretation of findings and highlights the need for further research."

    "query": "Title: Psychological therapies for women who experience intimate partner violence\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nIntimate partner violence (IPV) against women is prevalent and strongly associated with mental health problems. Women experiencing IPV attend health services frequently for mental health problems. The World Health Organization recommends that women who have experienced IPV and have a mental health diagnosis should receive evidence‐based mental health treatments. However, it is not known if psychological therapies work for women in the context of IPV and whether they cause harm. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies for women who experience IPV on the primary outcomes of depression, self‐efficacy and an indicator of harm (dropouts) at six‐ to 12‐months' follow‐up, and on secondary outcomes of other mental health symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, re‐exposure to IPV, safety planning and behaviours, use of healthcare and IPV services, and social support. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and three other databases, to the end of October 2019. We also searched international trials registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials and handsearched selected journals, reference lists of included trials and grey literature. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, cluster‐RCTs and cross‐over trials of psychological therapies with women aged 16 years and older who self‐reported recent or lifetime experience of IPV. We included trials if women also experienced co‐existing mental health diagnoses or substance abuse issues, or both. Psychological therapies included a wide range of interventions that targeted cognition, motivation and behaviour compared with usual care, no treatment, delayed or minimal interventions. We classified psychological therapies according to Cochrane Common Mental Disorders’s psychological therapies list. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors extracted data and undertook 'Risk of Bias' assessment. Treatment effects were compared between experimental and comparator interventions at short‐term (up to six months post‐baseline), medium‐term (six to under 12 months, primary outcome time point), and long‐term follow‐up (12 months and above). We used standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes, and used random‐effects meta‐analysis, due to high heterogeneity across trials. \nMain results:\nWe included 33 psychological trials involving 5517 women randomly assigned to experimental (2798 women, 51%) and comparator interventions (2719 women, 49%). Psychological therapies included 11 integrative therapies, nine humanistic therapies, six cognitive behavioural therapy, four third‐wave cognitive behavioural therapies and three other psychologically‐orientated interventions. There were no trials classified as psychodynamic therapies. Most trials were from high‐income countries (19 in USA, three in Iran, two each in Australia and Greece, and one trial each in China, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Spain and UK), among women recruited from healthcare, community, shelter or refuge settings, or a combination of any or all of these. Psychological therapies were mostly delivered face‐to‐face (28 trials), but varied by length of treatment (two to 50 sessions) and staff delivering therapies (social workers, nurses, psychologists, community health workers, family doctors, researchers). The average sample size was 82 women (14 to 479), aged 37 years on average, and 66% were unemployed. Half of the women were married or living with a partner and just over half of the participants had experienced IPV in the last 12 months (17 trials), 6% in the past two years (two trials) and 42% during their lifetime (14 trials). Whilst 20 trials (61%) described reliable low‐risk random‐sampling strategies, only 12 trials (36%) described reliable procedures to conceal the allocation of participant status. While 19 trials measured women's depression, only four trials measured depression as a continuous outcome at medium‐term follow‐up. These showed a probable beneficial effect of psychological therapies in reducing depression (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.47 to −0.01; four trials, 600 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, for self‐efficacy, there may be no evidence of a difference between groups (SMD −0.12, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.09; one trial with medium‐term follow‐up data, 346 women; low‐certainty evidence). Further, there may be no difference between the number of women who dropped out from the experimental or comparator intervention groups, an indicator of no harm (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.44; five trials with medium‐term follow‐up data, 840 women; low‐certainty evidence). Although no trials reported adverse events from psychological therapies or participation in the trial, only one trial measured harm outcomes using a validated scale. For secondary outcomes, trials measured anxiety only at short‐term follow‐up, showing that psychological therapies may reduce anxiety symptoms (SMD −0.96, 95% CI −1.29 to −0.63; four trials, 158 women; low‐certainty evidence). However, within medium‐term follow‐up, low‐certainty evidence revealed that there may be no evidence between groups for the outcomes safety planning (SMD 0.04, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.25; one trial, 337 women), post‐traumatic stress disorder (SMD −0.24, 95% CI −0.54 to 0.06; four trials, 484 women) or re‐exposure to any form of IPV (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.2; two trials, 547 women). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is evidence that for women who experience IPV, psychological therapies probably reduce depression and may reduce anxiety. However, we are uncertain whether psychological therapies improve other outcomes (self‐efficacy, post‐traumatic stress disorder, re‐exposure to IPV, safety planning) and there are limited data on harm. Thus, while psychological therapies probably improve emotional health, it is unclear if women's ongoing needs for safety, support and holistic healing from complex trauma are addressed by this approach. There is a need for more interventions focused on trauma approaches and more rigorous trials (with consistent outcomes at similar follow‐up time points), as we were unable to synthesise much of the research.",
    "reference_answer": "Here are the scoring reference points based on the main findings presented:\n\n- **Depression:**\n  - Psychological therapies probably reduce depression in women experiencing IPV.\n  - Moderate-certainty evidence supports a reduction in depressive symptoms (SMD −0.24).\n\n- **Anxiety:**\n  - Psychological therapies may reduce anxiety symptoms in the short term.\n  - Low-certainty evidence available for anxiety reduction (SMD −0.96).\n\n- **Self-Efficacy:**\n  - There is low-certainty evidence suggesting no significant effect on self-efficacy.\n\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**\n  - Uncertain evidence for the effect of psychological therapies on PTSD.\n  - Low-certainty evidence indicates no significant difference in PTSD outcomes (SMD −0.24).\n\n- **Safety Planning:**\n  - Psychological therapies show uncertain effects on women's safety planning abilities.\n  - Low-certainty evidence suggests no significant improvement (SMD 0.04).\n\n- **Re-exposure to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV):**\n  - Uncertain evidence regarding the effect of psychological therapies on re-exposure to IPV.\n  - Low-certainty evidence indicates no significant difference (SMD 0.03).\n\n- **Harm and Adverse Events:**\n  - No trials reported adverse events from psychological therapies or participation in the trials.\n  - Dropout rates were similar between intervention and comparator groups, suggesting no indication of harm (OR 1.04).\n\n- **Overall Conclusions:**\n  - Psychological therapies probably improve emotional health but do not clearly meet ongoing needs for safety or holistic trauma healing.\n  - More robust and consistent trials are needed to better understand effects on additional outcomes beyond depression and anxiety.\n\nEach of these points captures a critical aspect of the study's main findings and provides a structured reference for evaluating the effectiveness of psychological therapies in women experiencing IPV."

    "query": "Title: Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nMany people with schizophrenia do not achieve satisfactory improvements in their mental state, particularly the symptom of hearing voices (hallucinations), with medical treatment. \nObjectives:\nTo examine the effects of Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. \nSearch methods:\nIn December 2016, November 2018 and April 2019, the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (including registries of clinical trials) was searched, review authors checked references of all identified relevant reports to identify more studies and contacted authors of trials for additional information. \nSelection criteria:\nAll randomised clinical trials focusing on Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and 95% CIs. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in; mental state, insight, global state, quality of life and functioning as well as adverse effects and leaving the study early. \nMain results:\nWe found 14 potentially relevant references for three studies (participants = 195) comparing Avatar Therapy with two other interventions; treatment as usual or supportive counselling. Both Avatar Therapy and supportive counselling were given in addition (add‐on) to the participants' normal care. All of the studies had high risk of bias across one or more domains for methodology and, for other risks of bias, authors from one of the studies were involved in the development of the avatar systems on trial and in another trial, authors had patents on the avatar system pending. 1. Avatar Therapy compared with treatment as usual When Avatar Therapy was compared with treatment as usual average endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale – Positive (PANSS‐P) scores were not different between treatment groups (MD –1.93, 95% CI –5.10 to 1.24; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low‐certainty evidence). A measure of insight (Revised Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire; BAVQ‐R) showed an effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD –5.97, 95% CI –10.98 to –0.96; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low‐certainty evidence). No one was rehospitalised in either group in the short term (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI –0.20 to 0.20; studies = 1, participants = 19; low‐certainty evidence). Numbers leaving the study early from each group were not clearly different – although more did leave from the Avatar Therapy group (6/14 versus 0/12; RR 11.27, 95% CI 0.70 to 181.41; studies = 1, participants = 26; low‐certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in anxiety between treatment groups (RR 5.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 89.80; studies = 1, participants = 19; low‐certainty evidence). For quality of life, average Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire‐Short Form (QLESQ‐SF) scores favoured Avatar Therapy (MD 9.99, 95% CI 3.89 to 16.09; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low‐certainty evidence ) . No study reported data for functioning. 2. Avatar Therapy compared with supportive counselling When Avatar Therapy was compared with supportive counselling (all short‐term), general mental state (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS)) scores favoured the Avatar Therapy group (MD –4.74, 95% CI –8.01 to –1.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low‐certainty evidence). For insight (BAVQ‐R), there was a small effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD –8.39, 95% CI –14.31 to –2.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low‐certainty evidence). Around 20% of each group left the study early (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.89; studies = 1, participants = 150; moderate‐certainty evidence). Analysis of quality of life scores (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA)) showed no clear difference between groups (MD 2.69, 95% CI –1.48 to 6.86; studies = 1, participants = 120; low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for rehospitalisation rates, adverse events or functioning. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nOur analyses of available data shows few, if any, consistent effects of Avatar Therapy for people living with schizophrenia who experience auditory hallucinations. Where there are effects, or suggestions of effects, we are uncertain because of their risk of bias and their unclear clinical meaning. The theory behind Avatar Therapy is compelling but the practice needs testing in large, long, well‐designed, well‐reported randomised trials undertaken with help from – but not under the direction of – Avatar Therapy pioneers.",

    "query": "Title: Simulated presence therapy for dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDementia is a common and serious neuropsychiatric syndrome, characterised by progressive cognitive and functional decline. The majority of people with dementia develop behavioural disturbances, also known as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Several non‐pharmacological interventions have been evaluated to treat BPSD in people with dementia. Simulated presence therapy (SPT), an intervention that uses video or audiotape recordings of family members played to the person with dementia, is a possible approach to treat BPSD. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of SPT on behavioural and psychological symptoms and quality of life in people with dementia. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library ) (9 April 2020), MEDLINE Ovid SP (1946 to 9 April 2020), Embase Ovid SP (1972 to 9 April 2020), PsycINFO Ovid SP (1806 to 9 April 2020), CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1980 to 9 April 2020), LILACS via BIREME (all dates to 9 April 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov ( ClinicalTrials.gov ) (all dates to 9 April 2020), and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal ( apps.who.int/trialsearch ) (all dates to 9 April 2020). We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify any additional studies. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials, including cross‐over studies, that evaluated the efficacy of SPT, consisting of personalised audio or videotape recordings of family members, in people with any form of dementia. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. No meta‐analyses were conducted because of substantial heterogeneity among the included studies. \nMain results:\nThree trials with 144 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two of the trials had a randomised cross‐over design, one was a cross‐over trial which we classified as quasi‐randomised. Participants in the included studies were people with dementia living in nursing homes. They were predominantly women and had a mean age of over 80 years. SPT was performed using an audio or video recording prepared by family members or surrogates. It varied in its content, frequency of administration and duration. All the studies compared multiple treatments. In one study, SPT was compared with two other interventions; in the other two studies, it was compared with three other interventions. Specifically, SPT was compared to usual care, personalised music (two studies), a 'placebo' audiotape containing the voice of a person (two studies), and one‐to‐one social interaction performed by trained research assistants (one study). In terms of outcomes evaluated, one study considered agitation and withdrawn behaviour (both assessed with three methods); the second study evaluated verbal disruptive behaviour (assessed with three methods); and the third study evaluated physically agitated behaviour and verbally agitated behaviour (the method used was not clearly described). According to the GRADE criteria, the overall quality of the evidence was very low due to very small numbers of participants and risk of bias in the included studies; (none of the trials was at low risk of selection bias; all the trials were at high risk of performance bias; one trial was at high risk of attrition bias; and all had unclear selective reporting). Because of variation in the participants, the format of SPT, the comparison interventions, and the measures used to assess outcomes, we judged the results unsuitable for a meta‐analysis. Within each trial, the effect of SPT on behaviour, compared to usual care, was mixed and depended on the measure used. Two trials which included a personalised music intervention reported no significant differences between simulated presence and music on behavioural outcomes. Because the overall quality of the evidence was very low, we were very uncertain regarding all the results None of the studies evaluated quality of life or any of our secondary outcome measures (performance of activities of daily living, dropout and carer burden). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe were unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of SPT for treating behavioural and psychological symptoms and improving quality of life of people with dementia. New high‐quality studies are needed to investigate the effect of SPT.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the main findings of the study and the analysis provided by different models, the essential scoring reference points for the findings of the study on Simulated Presence Therapy (SPT) for dementia are as follows:\n\n- **Variability in Outcomes**: The effect of SPT on behavioral symptoms varied within individual trials, and the results were mixed, depending on the measurement method used to assess these outcomes.\n\n- **Comparison with Personalized Music**: Two trials did not find significant differences in behavioral outcomes when comparing SPT to personalized music interventions.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence**: The overall quality of evidence from the study was very low due to the small sample size and inherent risk of bias across the included studies.\n\n- **Risk of Bias**: All included trials exhibited a high risk of performance bias, and none of the trials were at low risk of selection bias. One trial showed a high risk of attrition bias, while all trials had unclear selective reporting, further contributing to the low quality of evidence.\n\n- **Lack of Comprehensive Outcomes**: The studies did not evaluate several important outcomes, such as quality of life, performance of activities of daily living, dropout rates, and carer burden, limiting the scope of the findings.\n\n- **Need for Further Research**: Due to the low quality of evidence and inconclusive findings, there is a need for new, high-quality studies to properly investigate the effects of SPT on behavioral and psychological symptoms and the quality of life in people with dementia."

    "query": "Title: Benzodiazepines for treatment of patients with delirium excluding those who are cared for in an intensive care unit\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDelirium is a very common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Current critical care guidelines recommend first and foremost the use of nonpharmacological strategies in both the prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacological interventions may augment these approaches and they are currently used widely in clinical practice to manage the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines are currently used in clinical practice to treat behavioural disturbances associated with delirium but current guidelines do not recommend their use for this indication. The use of these medicines is controversial because there is uncertainty about whether they are effective for patients or have the potential to harm them. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium (excluding delirium related to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines) in any healthcare settings other than intensive care units (ICU). \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 10 April 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmaceutical registries), and grey literature sources. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in healthcare settings that ranged from nursing homes and long‐term care facilities to any hospital setting except for ICUs, involving adult patients with delirium excluding those with delirium related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Included RCTs had to assess the effect of benzodiazepines, at any dose and given by any route, compared with placebo or another drug intended to treat delirium. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We decided whether or not to pool data on the basis of clinical heterogeneity between studies. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence. \nMain results:\nWe identified only two trials that satisfied the selection criteria. We did not pool the data because of the substantial clinical differences between the trials. In one trial, participants (n = 58) were patients in an acute palliative care unit with advanced cancer who had a mean age of 64 years. All of the participants had delirium, were treated with haloperidol, and were randomised to receive either lorazepam or placebo in combination with it. Due to very serious imprecision, all evidence was of low certainty. We were unable to determine whether there were clinically important differences in the severity of delirium (mean difference (MD) 2.10, 95% CI ‐0.96 to 5.16; n = 50), length of hospital admission (MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐3.45 to 3.45; n = 58), mortality from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.02; participants = 58) or any of a number of adverse events. Important effects could not be confirmed or excluded. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode. In the other trial, participants (n = 30) were patients in general medical wards with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who had a mean age of 39.2 years. Investigators compared three drug treatments: all participants had delirium, and were randomised to receive lorazepam, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol. Very low‐certainty evidence was identified, and we could not determine whether lorazepam differed from either of the other treatments in the effect on severity of delirium, any adverse event, or mortality from all causes. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode or the length of hospital admission. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThere is no enough evidence to determine whether benzodiazepines are effective when used to treat patients with delirium who are cared for in non‐ICU settings. The available evidence does not support their routine use for this indication. Because of the scarcity of data from randomised controlled trials, further research is required to determine whether or not there is a role for benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium in non‐ICU settings.",

    "query": "Title: Computerised cognitive training for 12 or more weeks for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nIncreasing age is associated with a natural decline in cognitive function and is the greatest risk factor for dementia. Cognitive decline and dementia are significant threats to independence and quality of life in older adults. Therefore, identifying interventions that help to maintain cognitive function in older adults or that reduce the risk of dementia is a research priority. Cognitive training uses repeated practice on standardised exercises targeting one or more cognitive domains and may be intended to improve or maintain optimal cognitive function. This review examines the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on the cognitive function of healthy adults aged 65 or older and has formed part of a wider project about modifying lifestyle to maintain cognitive function. We chose a minimum 12 weeks duration as a trade‐off between adequate exposure to a sustainable intervention and feasibility in a trial setting. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effects of computerised cognitive training interventions lasting at least 12 weeks on cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched to 31 March 2018 in ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), and we performed additional searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Portal/ICTRP ( www.apps.who.int/trialsearch ), to ensure that the search was as comprehensive and as up‐to‐date as possible to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs, published or unpublished, reported in any language. Participants were cognitively healthy people, and at least 80% of the study population had to be aged 65 or older. Experimental interventions adhered to the following criteria: intervention was any form of interactive computerised cognitive intervention ‐ including computer exercises, computer games, mobile devices, gaming console, and virtual reality ‐ that involved repeated practice on standardised exercises of specified cognitive domain(s) for the purpose of enhancing cognitive function; the duration of the intervention was at least 12 weeks; cognitive outcomes were measured; and cognitive training interventions were compared with active or inactive control interventions. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe performed preliminary screening of search results using a 'crowdsourcing' method to identify RCTs. At least two review authors working independently screened the remaining citations against inclusion criteria. At least two review authors also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs. Where appropriate, we synthesised data in random‐effects meta‐analyses, comparing computerised cognitive training (CCT) separately with active and inactive controls. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE methods to describe the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome. \nMain results:\nWe identified eight RCTs with a total of 1183 participants. The duration of the interventions ranged from 12 to 26 weeks; in five trials, the duration of intervention was 12 or 13 weeks. The included studies had moderate risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. We compared CCT first against active control interventions, such as watching educational videos. Negative SMDs favour CCT over control. Trial results suggest slight improvement in global cognitive function at the end of the intervention period (12 weeks) (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.57 to ‐0.05; 232 participants; 2 studies; low‐quality evidence). One of these trials also assessed global cognitive function 12 months after the end of the intervention; this trial provided no clear evidence of a persistent effect (SMD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.66 to 0.24; 77 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). CCT may result in little or no difference at the end of the intervention period in episodic memory (12 to 17 weeks) (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.26; 439 participants; 4 studies; low‐quality evidence) or working memory (12 to 16 weeks) (SMD ‐0.17, 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.02; 392 participants; 3 studies; low‐quality evidence). Because of the very low quality of the evidence, we are very uncertain about the effects of CCT on speed of processing and executive function. We also compared CCT to inactive control (no interventions). We found no data on our primary outcome of global cognitive function. At the end of the intervention, CCT may lead to slight improvement in episodic memory (6 months) (mean difference (MD) in Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) ‐0.90 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.73 to ‐0.07; 150 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence) but can have little or no effect on executive function (12 weeks to 6 months) (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.15; 292 participants; 2 studies; low‐quality evidence), working memory (16 weeks) (MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.27; 60 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence), or verbal fluency (6 months) (MD ‐0.11, 95% CI ‐1.58 to 1.36; 150 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). We could not determine any effects on speed of processing because the evidence was of very low quality. We found no evidence on quality of life, activities of daily living, or adverse effects in either comparison. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found low‐quality evidence suggesting that immediately after completion of the intervention, small benefits of CCT may be seen for global cognitive function when compared with active controls, and for episodic memory when compared with an inactive control. These benefits are of uncertain clinical importance. We found no evidence that the effect on global cognitive function persisted 12 months later. Our confidence in the results was low, reflecting the overall quality of the evidence. In five of the eight trials, the duration of the intervention was just three months. The possibility that more extensive training could yield larger benefit remains to be more fully explored. We found substantial literature on cognitive training, and collating all available scientific information posed problems. Duration of treatment may not be the best way to categorise interventions for inclusion. As the primary interest of older people and of guideline writers and policymakers involves sustained cognitive benefit, an alternative would be to categorise by length of follow‐up after selecting studies that assess longer‐term effects.",

    "query": "Title: Cognitive training interventions for dementia and mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nApproximately 60% to 80% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience cognitive impairment that impacts on their quality of life. Cognitive decline is a core feature of the disease and can often present before the onset of motor symptoms. Cognitive training may be a useful non‐pharmacological intervention that could help to maintain or improve cognition and quality of life for people with PD dementia (PDD) or PD‐related mild cognitive impairment (PD‐MCI). \nObjectives:\nTo determine whether cognitive training (targeting single or multiple domains) improves cognition in people with PDD and PD‐MCI or other clearly defined forms of cognitive impairment in people with PD. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Trials Register (8 August 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We searched reference lists and trial registers, searched relevant reviews in the area and conference proceedings. We also contacted experts for clarifications on data and ongoing trials. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials where the participants had PDD or PD‐MCI, and where the intervention was intended to train general or specific areas of cognitive function, targeting either a single domain or multiple domains of cognition, and was compared to a control condition. Multicomponent interventions that also included motor or other elements were considered eligible. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles for inclusion in the review. Two review authors also independently undertook extraction of data and assessment of methodological quality. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of the evidence. \nMain results:\nSeven studies with a total of 225 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. All seven studies compared the effects of a cognitive training intervention to a control intervention at the end of treatment periods lasting four to eight weeks. Six studies included people with PD living in the community. These six studies recruited people with single‐domain (executive) or multiple‐domain mild cognitive impairment in PD. Four of these studies identified participants with MCI using established diagnostic criteria, and two included both people with PD‐MCI and people with PD who were not cognitively impaired. One study recruited people with a diagnosis of PD dementia who were living in long‐term care settings. The cognitive training intervention in three studies targeted a single cognitive domain, whilst in four studies multiple domains of cognitive function were targeted. The comparison groups either received no intervention or took part in recreational activities (sports, music, arts), speech or language exercises, computerised motor therapy, or motor rehabilitation combined with recreational activity. We found no clear evidence that cognitive training improved global cognition. Although cognitive training was associated with higher scores on global cognition at the end of treatment, the result was imprecise and not statistically significant (6 trials, 178 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.03 to 0.59; low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference at the end of treatment between cognitive training and control interventions on executive function (5 trials, 112 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.48; low‐certainty evidence) or visual processing (3 trials, 64 participants; SMD 0.30, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.81; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence favoured the cognitive training group on attention (5 trials, 160 participants; SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.68; low‐certainty evidence) and verbal memory (5 trials, 160 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.69; low‐certainty evidence), but these effects were less certain in sensitivity analyses that excluded a study in which only a minority of the sample were cognitively impaired. There was no evidence of differences between treatment and control groups in activities of daily living (3 trials, 67 participants; SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.47 to 0.53; low‐certainty evidence) or quality of life (5 trials, 147 participants; SMD −0.01, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.33; low‐certainty evidence). There was very little information on adverse events. We considered the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to be low due to risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision of the results. We identified six ongoing trials recruiting participants with PD‐MCI, but no ongoing trials of cognitive training for people with PDD. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThis review found no evidence that people with PD‐MCI or PDD who receive cognitive training for four to eight weeks experience any important cognitive improvements at the end of training. However, this conclusion was based on a small number of studies with few participants, limitations of study design and execution, and imprecise results. There is a need for more robust, adequately powered studies of cognitive training before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of cognitive training for people with PDD and PD‐MCI. Studies should use formal criteria to diagnose cognitive impairments, and there is a particular need for more studies testing the efficacy of cognitive training in people with PDD.",

    "query": "Title: Means restriction for the prevention of suicide by jumping\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nJumping from a height is an uncommon but lethal means of suicide. Restricting access to means is an important universal or population‐based approach to suicide prevention with clear evidence of its effectiveness. However, the evidence with respect to means restriction for the prevention of suicide by jumping is not well established. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide by jumping. These include the use of physical barriers, fencing or safety nets at frequently‐used jumping sites, or restriction of access to these sites, such as by way of road closures. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science to May 2019. We conducted additional searches of the international trial registries including the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, to identify relevant unpublished and ongoing studies. We searched the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies and contacted authors and subject experts for information on unpublished or ongoing studies. We applied no restrictions on date, language or publication status to the searches. Two review authors independently assessed all citations from the searches and identified relevant titles and abstracts. Our main outcomes of interest were suicide, attempted suicide or self‐harm, and cost‐effectiveness of interventions. \nSelection criteria:\nEligible studies were randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials, controlled intervention studies without randomisation, before‐and‐after studies, or studies using interrupted time series designs, which evaluated interventions to restrict the availability of, or access to, means of suicide by jumping. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and three review authors extracted study data. We pooled studies that evaluated similar interventions and outcomes using a random‐effects meta‐analysis, and we synthesised data from other studies in a narrative summary. We summarised the quality of the evidence included in this review using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe included 14 studies in this review. Thirteen were before‐and‐after studies and one was a cost‐effectiveness analysis. Three studies each took place in Switzerland and the USA, while two studies each were from the UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia respectively. The majority of studies (10/14) assessed jumping means restriction interventions delivered in isolation, half of which were at bridges. Due to the observational nature of included studies, none compared comparator interventions or control conditions. During the pre‐ and postintervention period among the 13 before‐and‐after studies, a total of 742.3 suicides (5.5 suicides per year) occurred during the pre‐intervention period (134.5 study years), while 70.6 suicides (0.8 suicides per year) occurred during the postintervention period (92.4 study years) ‐ a 91% reduction in suicides. A meta‐analysis of all studies assessing jumping means restriction interventions (delivered in isolation or in combination with other interventions) showed a directionality of effect in favour of the interventions, as evidenced by a reduction in the number of suicides at intervention sites (12 studies; incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.27; P < 0.001; I 2  = 88.40%). Similar findings were demonstrated for studies assessing jumping means restriction interventions delivered in isolation (9 studies; IRR = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.16; P < 0.001; I 2  = 73.67%), studies assessing jumping means restriction interventions delivered in combination with other interventions (3 studies; IRR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; P = 0.03; I 2  = 40.8%), studies assessing the effectiveness of physical barriers (7 studies; IRR = 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.24; P < 0.001; I 2  = 84.07%), and studies assessing the effectiveness of safety nets (2 studies; IRR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.30; P = 0.07; I 2  = 29.3%). Data on suicide attempts were limited and none of the studies used self‐harm as an outcome. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies for the primary outcome (suicide) in the majority of the analyses except those relating to jumping means restriction delivered in combination with other interventions, and safety nets. Nevertheless, every study included in the forest plots showed the same directional effects in favour of jumping means restriction. Due to methodological limitations of the included studies, we rated the quality of the evidence from these studies as low. A cost‐effectiveness analysis suggested that the construction of a physical barrier on a bridge would be a highly cost‐effective project in the long term as a result of overall reduced suicide mortality. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThe findings from this review suggest that jumping means restriction interventions are capable of reducing the frequency of suicides by jumping. However, due to methodological limitations of included studies, this finding is based on low‐quality evidence. Therefore, further well‐designed high‐quality studies are required to further evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions, as well as other measures at jumping sites. In addition, further research is required to investigate the potential for suicide method substitution and displacement effects in populations exposed to interventions to prevent suicide by jumping.",
    "reference_answer": "### Main Findings - Scoring Reference Points\n\n- **Effectiveness of Means Restriction Interventions:**\n  - Evidence shows a 91% reduction in suicide rates at intervention sites comparing pre- and post-intervention periods.\n  - Main effect demonstrated by an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.09, showing significant effectiveness of interventions (P < 0.001).\n\n- **Effectiveness in Delivered Isolation vs. Combination:**\n  - Jumping means restrictions delivered in isolation show a strong effect with an IRR of 0.05 (P < 0.001).\n  - Interventions delivered in combination with other measures showed lesser but significant effect (IRR = 0.54, P = 0.03).\n\n- **Effectiveness of Specific Interventions:**\n  - **Physical Barriers:** Demonstrated significant reduction in suicides (IRR = 0.07, P < 0.001).\n  - **Safety Nets:** Lesser evidence, showing potential effectiveness (IRR = 0.09, P = 0.07), though not reaching statistical significance.\n\n- **Overall Heterogeneity:**\n  - High heterogeneity was noted across studies (I^2 = 88.40%) for means restriction in general.\n  - Lower heterogeneity for combined interventions (I^2 = 40.8%) and safety nets (I^2 = 29.3%).\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - The overall quality of evidence is rated as low due to methodological limitations.\n  \n- **Cost-Effectiveness:**\n  - A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that physical barriers on bridges could be highly cost-effective long-term.\n\n- **Data Limitations:**\n  - Limited data on suicide attempts.\n  - Lack of studies utilizing self-harm as an outcome measure.\n\n- **Need for Further Research:**\n  - High-quality studies needed to verify findings and assess method substitution/displacement effects.\n  - Exploration of additional measures at jumping sites is recommended.\n\nThese scoring criteria are based on the main findings as detailed in the abstract, offering a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of means restriction for suicide prevention by jumping."

    "query": "Title: Enhanced rehabilitation and care models for adults with dementia following hip fracture surgery\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nHip fracture is a major injury that causes significant problems for affected individuals and their family and carers. Over 40% of people with hip fracture have dementia or cognitive impairment. The outcomes of these individuals after surgery are poorer than for those without dementia. It is unclear which care and rehabilitation interventions achieve the best outcomes for these people. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013. \nObjectives:\n(a) To assess the effectiveness of models of care including enhanced rehabilitation strategies designed specifically for people with dementia following hip fracture surgery compared to usual care. (b) To assess for people with dementia the effectiveness of models of care including enhanced rehabilitation strategies that are designed for all older people, regardless of cognitive status, following hip fracture surgery, compared to usual care. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS ( www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois ), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 16 October 2019. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of any model of enhanced care and rehabilitation for people with dementia after hip fracture surgery compared to usual care. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials. We synthesised data only if we considered the trials to be sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions, and outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome. \nMain results:\nWe included seven trials with a total of 555 participants. Three trials compared models of enhanced care in the inpatient setting with conventional care. Two trials compared an enhanced care model provided in inpatient settings and at home after discharge with conventional care. Two trials compared geriatrician‐led care in‐hospital to conventional care led by the orthopaedic team. None of the interventions were designed specifically for people with dementia, therefore the data included in the review were from subgroups of people with dementia or cognitive impairment participating in randomised controlled trials investigating models of care for all older people following hip fracture. The end of follow‐up in the trials ranged from the point of acute hospital discharge to 24 months after discharge. We considered all trials to be at high risk of bias in more than one domain. As subgroups of larger trials, the analyses lacked power to detect differences between the intervention groups. Furthermore, there were some important differences in baseline characteristics of participants between the experimental and control groups. Using the GRADE approach, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to low or very low. The effect estimates for almost all comparisons were very imprecise, and the overall certainty for most results was very low. There were no data from any study for our primary outcome of health‐related quality of life. There was only very low certainty for our other primary outcome, activities of daily living and functional performance, therefore we were unable to draw any conclusions with confidence. There was low‐certainty that enhanced care and rehabilitation in‐hospital may reduce rates of postoperative delirium (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.22, 2 trials, n = 141) and very low‐certainty associating it with lower rates of some other complications. There was also low‐certainty that, compared to orthopaedic‐led management, geriatrician‐led management may lead to shorter hospital stays (mean difference 4.00 days, 95% CI 3.61 to 4.39, 1 trial, n = 162). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found limited evidence that some of the models of enhanced rehabilitation and care used in the included trials may show benefits over usual care for preventing delirium and reducing length of stay for people with dementia who have been treated for hip fracture. However, the certainty of these results is low. Data were available from only a small number of trials, and the certainty for all other results is very low. Determining the optimal strategies to improve outcomes for this growing population of patients should be a research priority.",

    "query": "Title: Interventions for chronic pruritus of unknown origin\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPruritus is a sensation that leads to the desire to scratch; its origin is unknown in 8% to 15% of affected patients. The prevalence of chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) in individuals with generalised pruritus ranges from 3.6% to 44.5%, with highest prevalence among the elderly. When the origin of pruritus is known, its management may be straightforward if an effective treatment for the causal disease is available. Treatment of CPUO is particularly difficult due to its unknown pathophysiology. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of interventions for CPUO in adults and children. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the following up to July 2019: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for additional references to relevant trials. \nSelection criteria:\nWe sought to include randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that assessed interventions for CPUO, as defined in category VI ('Other pruritus of undetermined origin, or chronic pruritus of unknown origin') of the International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI) classification, in children and adults. Eligible interventions were non‐pharmacological or topical or systemic pharmacological interventions, and eligible comparators were another active treatment, placebo, sham procedures, or no treatment or equivalent (e.g. waiting list). \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'Patient‐ or parent‐reported pruritus intensity' and 'Adverse events'. Our secondary outcomes were 'Health‐related quality of life', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Depression', and 'Patient satisfaction'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. \nMain results:\nWe found there was an absence of evidence for the main interventions of interest: emollient creams, cooling lotions, topical corticosteroids, topical antidepressants, systemic antihistamines, systemic antidepressants, systemic anticonvulsants, and phototherapy. We included one study with 257 randomised (253 analysed) participants, aged 18 to 65 years; 60.6% were female. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of three different doses of oral serlopitant (5 mg, 1 mg, and 0.25 mg, once daily for six weeks) compared to placebo for severe chronic pruritus; 25 US centres participated (clinical research centres and universities). All outcomes were measured at the end of treatment (six weeks from baseline), except adverse events, which were monitored throughout. A pharmaceutical company funded this study. Fifty‐five per cent of participants suffered from CPUO, and approximately 45% presented a dermatological diagnosis (atopic dermatitis/eczema 37.3%, psoriasis 6.7%, acne 3.6%, among other diagnoses). We unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve outcome data from study authors for the subgroup of participants with CPUO. Participants had pruritus for six weeks or longer. Total study duration was 10 weeks. Participants who received serlopitant 5 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient‐reported pruritus intensity as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS; a reduction in VAS score indicates improvement) compared to placebo (126 participants, risk ratio (RR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 3.35; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 5 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low‐certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.50); health‐related quality of life (as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); a higher score indicates greater impairment; 127 participants; mean difference (MD) ‐4.20, 95% CI ‐11.68 to 3.28); and sleep disturbances (people with insomnia measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Symptom Questionnaire‐Insomnia (PSSQ‐I), a dichotomous measure; 128 participants; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.01). Participants who received serlopitant 1 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient‐reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (126 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.54; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 1 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low‐certainty evidence: adverse events (128 participants; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.47); health‐related quality of life (DLQI; 128 participants; MD ‐6.90, 95% CI ‐14.38 to 0.58); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ‐I; 128 participants; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.84). Participants who received serlopitant 0.25 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient‐reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (127 participants; RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.77; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 0.25 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low‐certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.24); health‐related quality of life (DLQI; 127 participants; MD ‐5.70, 95% CI ‐13.18 to 1.78); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ‐I; 127 participants; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.17). The most commonly reported adverse events were somnolence, diarrhoea, headache, and nasopharyngitis, among others. Our included study did not measure depression or patient satisfaction. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes due to indirectness (only 55% of study participants had CPUO) and imprecision. We downgraded outcomes other than patient‐reported pruritus intensity a further level due to concerns regarding risk of bias in selection of the reported result and some concerns with risk of bias due to missing outcome data (sleep disturbances only). We deemed risk of bias to be generally low. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found lack of evidence to address our review question: for most of our interventions of interest, we found no eligible studies. The neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist serlopitant was the only intervention that we could assess. One study provided low‐certainty evidence suggesting that serlopitant may reduce pruritus intensity when compared with placebo. We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant on other outcomes, as certainty of the evidence is very low. More studies with larger sample sizes, focused on patients with CPUO, are needed. Healthcare professionals, patients, and other stakeholders may have to rely on indirect evidence related to other forms of chronic pruritus when deciding between the main interventions currently used for this condition.",
    "reference_answer": "**Scoring Criteria for Main Findings of the Study on Serlopitant for CPUO**\n\n- **Patient-Reported Pruritus Intensity:** \n  - Serlopitant (5 mg) versus placebo: Evidence suggests greater pruritus relief with a risk ratio (RR) of 2.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 3.35). Scores should reflect a visual analogue scale (VAS) reduction.\n  - Serlopitant (1 mg) versus placebo: Scores should consider RR 1.50 (95% CI 0.89 to 2.54), indicating potential relief but uncertain magnitude compared to placebo.\n  - Serlopitant (0.25 mg) versus placebo: Scores reflect RR 1.66 (95% CI 1.00 to 2.77) for pruritus relief, noting uncertainty.\n\n- **Adverse Events:** \n  - Evaluate serlopitant doses against placebo: \n    - 5 mg: RR 1.48 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.50), indicating uncertainty.\n    - 1 mg: RR 1.45 (95% CI 0.86 to 2.47), noting very low certainty.\n    - 0.25 mg: RR 1.29 (95% CI 0.75 to 2.24), reflecting low certainty.\n  - Common adverse events include somnolence, diarrhoea, headache, and nasopharyngitis.\n\n- **Health-Related Quality of Life:** \n  - Measure using DLQI: \n    - Serlopitant 5 mg: Mean difference (MD) -4.20 (95% CI -11.68 to 3.28), indicating very low certainty.\n    - Serlopitant 1 mg: MD -6.90 (95% CI -14.38 to 0.58), reflecting uncertainty and indirect evidence.\n    - Serlopitant 0.25 mg: MD -5.70 (95% CI -13.18 to 1.78); assess changes in DLQI scores for impairment.\n\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** \n  - Utilize Pittsburgh Sleep Symptom Questionnaire-Insomnia (PSSQ-I): \n    - 5 mg: RR 0.49 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.01)\n    - 1 mg: RR 0.38 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.84)\n    - 0.25 mg: RR 0.60 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.17)\n  - Scores should reflect the presence or absence of sleep disturbance change.\n\n- **Depression and Patient Satisfaction:** \n  - Evidence not measured; hence no scoring for these categories.\n\n**Methodological and Evidence Certainty Considerations:**\n- Indirectness due to only 55% of study participants having CPUO.\n- Imprecision in estimates due to wide confidence intervals.\n- Risk of bias considerations primarily low, but downgraded due to selection of reported result and missing data (especially for sleep disturbances).\n- Note pharmaceutical company funding, which may impact bias perceptions.\n\n**Overall Evidence Certainty:**\n- Categorize findings as low to very low certainty based on GRADE assessment due to indirectness, imprecision, and bias concerns."

    "query": "Title: Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nDelirium is a syndrome characterised by an acute disturbance of attention and awareness which develops over a short time period and fluctuates in severity over the course of the day. It is commonly experienced during inpatient admission in the terminal phase of illness. It can cause symptoms such as agitation and hallucinations and is distressing for terminally ill people, their families and staff. Delirium may arise from any number of causes and treatment should aim to address these causes. When this is not possible, or treatment is unsuccessful, drug therapy to manage the symptoms may become necessary. This is the second update of the review first published in 2004. \nObjectives:\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drug therapies to manage delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from inception to July 2019, reference lists of retrieved papers, and online trial registries. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials of drug therapies in any dose by any route, compared to another drug therapy, a non‐pharmacological approach, placebo, standard care or wait‐list control, for the management of delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults (18 years or older). \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were delirium symptoms; agitation score; adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: use of rescue medication; cognitive status; survival. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome and we include eight 'Summary of findings' tables. \nMain results:\nWe included four studies (three new to this update), with 399 participants. Most participants had advanced cancer or advanced AIDS, and mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium. Meta‐analysis was not possible because no two studies examined the same comparison. Each study was at high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Most evidence was low to very low quality, downgraded due to very serious study limitations, imprecision or because there were so few data. Most studies reported delirium symptoms; two reported agitation scores; three reported adverse events with data on extrapyramidal effects; and none reported serious adverse events. 1. Haloperidol versus placebo There may be little to no difference between placebo and haloperidol in delirium symptoms within 24 hours (mean difference (MD) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.07 to 0.75; 133 participants). Haloperidol may slightly worsen delirium symptoms compared with placebo at 48 hours (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; 123 participants with mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium). Haloperidol may reduce agitation slightly compared with placebo between 24 and 48 hours (MD −0.14, 95% −0.28 to −0.00; 123 participants with mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium). Haloperidol probably increases extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.41; 123 participants with mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium). 2. Haloperidol versus risperidone There may be little to no difference in delirium symptoms with haloperidol compared with risperidone within 24 hours (MD −0.42, 95% CI −0.90 to 0.06; 126 participants) or 48 hours (MD −0.36, 95% CI −0.92 to 0.20; 106 participants with mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium). Agitation scores and adverse events were not reported for this comparison. 3. Haloperidol versus olanzapine We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with olanzapine within 24 hours (MD 2.36, 95% CI −0.75 to 5.47; 28 participants) or 48 hours (MD 1.90, 95% CI −1.50 to 5.30, 24 participants). Agitation scores and adverse events were not reported for this comparison. 4. Risperidone versus placebo Risperidone may slightly worsen delirium symptoms compared with placebo within 24 hours (MD 0.76, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.22; 129 participants); and at 48 hours (MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.38; 111 participants with mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium). There may be little to no difference in agitation with risperidone compared with placebo between 24 and 48 hours (MD −0.05, 95% CI −0.19 to 0.09; 111 participants with mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium). Risperidone may increase extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (MD 0.73 95% CI 0.09 to 1.37; 111 participants with mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium). 5. Lorazepam plus haloperidol versus placebo plus haloperidol We are uncertain whether lorazepam plus haloperidol compared with placebo plus haloperidol improves delirium symptoms within 24 hours (MD 2.10, 95% CI −1.00 to 5.20; 50 participants with moderate to severe delirium), reduces agitation within 24 hours (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.80; 52 participants), or increases adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI −0.19 to 2.63; 31 participants with moderate to severe delirium). 6. Haloperidol versus chlorpromazine We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with chlorpromazine at 48 hours (MD 0.37, 95% CI −4.58 to 5.32; 24 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. We are uncertain whether haloperidol increases adverse events compared with chlorpromazine (MD 0.46, 95% CI −4.22 to 5.14; 24 participants). 7. Haloperidol versus lorazepam We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with lorazepam at 48 hours (MD −4.88, 95% CI −9.70 to 0.06; 17 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. We are uncertain whether haloperidol increases adverse events compared with lorazepam (MD −6.66, 95% CI −14.85 to 1.53; 17 participants). 8. Lorazepam versus chlorpromazine We are uncertain whether lorazepam reduces delirium symptoms compared with chlorpromazine at 48 hours (MD 5.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.12; 19 participants), or increases adverse events (MD 7.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.32; 18 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. Secondary outcomes: use of rescue medication, cognitive impairment, survival There were insufficient data to draw conclusions or assess GRADE. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found no high‐quality evidence to support or refute the use of drug therapy for delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults. We found low‐quality evidence that risperidone or haloperidol may slightly worsen delirium symptoms of mild to moderate severity for terminally ill people compared with placebo. We found moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence that haloperidol and risperidone may slightly increase extrapyramidal adverse events for people with mild‐ to moderate‐severity delirium. Given the small number of studies and participants on which current evidence is based, further research is essential.",

    "query": "Title: Pharmacy‐based management for depression in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nIt is common for people not to take antidepressant medication as prescribed, with around 50% of people likely to prematurely discontinue taking their medication after six months. Community pharmacists may be well placed to have a role in antidepressant management because of their unique pharmacotherapeutic knowledge and ease of access for people. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to offer proactive interventions to people with depression or depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of existing pharmacist‐based interventions is not yet well understood. The degree to which a pharmacy‐based management approach might be beneficial, acceptable to people, and effective as part of the overall management for those with depression is, to date, unclear. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will help answer these questions and add important knowledge to the currently sparse evidence base. \nObjectives:\nTo examine the effects of pharmacy‐based management interventions compared with active control (e.g. patient information materials or any other active intervention delivered by someone other than the pharmacist or the pharmacy team), waiting list, or treatment as usual (e.g. standard pharmacist advice or antidepressant education, signposting to support available in primary care services, brief medication counselling, and/or (self‐)monitoring of medication adherence offered by a healthcare professional outside the pharmacy team) at improving depression outcomes in adults. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR) to June 2016; the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018); and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to December 2018. We searched theses and dissertation databases and international trial registers for unpublished/ongoing trials. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches.  \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all RCTs and cluster‐RCTs where a pharmacy‐based intervention was compared with treatment as usual, waiting list, or an alternative intervention in the management of depression in adults over 16 years of age. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes at any time point: depression symptom change, acceptability of the intervention, diagnosis of depression, non‐adherence to medication, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or adverse events.  \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo authors independently, and in duplicate, conducted all stages of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment (including GRADE). We discussed disagreements within the team until we reached consensus. Where data did not allow meta‐analyses, we synthesised results narratively.  \nMain results:\nTwelve studies (2215 participants) met the inclusion criteria and compared pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual. Two studies (291 participants) also included an active control (both used patient information leaflets providing information about the prescribed antidepressant). Neither of these studies reported depression symptom change. A narrative synthesis of results on acceptability of the intervention was inconclusive, with one study reporting better acceptability of pharmacy‐based management and the other better acceptability of the active control. One study reported that participants in the pharmacy‐based management group had better medication adherence than the control participants. One study reported adverse events with no difference between groups. The studies reported no other outcomes. Meta‐analyses comparing pharmacy‐based management with treatment as usual showed no evidence of a difference in the effect of the intervention on depression symptom change (dichotomous data; improvement in symptoms yes/no: risk ratio (RR), 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 4 RCTs, 475 participants; moderate‐quality evidence; continuous data: standard mean difference (SMD) ‐0.04, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; 5 RCTs, 718 participants; high‐certainty evidence), or acceptability of the intervention (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.45; 12 RCTs, 2072 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The risk of non‐adherence was reduced in participants receiving pharmacy‐based management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; 6 RCTs, 911 participants; high‐certainty evidence). We were unable to meta‐analyse data on diagnosis of depression, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, or social functioning. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe found no evidence of a difference between pharmacy‐based management for depression in adults compared with treatment as usual in facilitating depression symptom change. Based on numbers of participants leaving the trials early, there may be no difference in acceptability between pharmacy‐based management and controls. However, there was uncertainty due to the low‐certainty evidence.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the main findings from the abstract and full-score answers, here is a set of scoring reference points structured in bullet points:\n\n- **Depression Symptom Change:**\n  - Evaluate whether there was any significant change in depression symptoms between pharmacy-based management and treatment as usual.\n  - Determine the quality of evidence available for this outcome (high to moderate-quality evidence).\n\n- **Acceptability of Intervention:**\n  - Assess the acceptability of pharmacy-based interventions compared to active controls and treatment as usual.\n  - Note variations across studies and the inconclusive nature of these findings.\n\n- **Medication Non-Adherence:**\n  - Measure the impact of pharmacy-based management on the risk of medication non-adherence.\n  - Use the provided risk ratio (RR 0.73) to quantify significance in reducing non-adherence.\n\n- **Adverse Events:**\n  - Identify any reported adverse events and determine if there are any significant differences between pharmacy-based management and controls.\n  - Confirm that no significant differences were noted in adverse events across interventions.\n\n- **Other Health Outcomes:**\n  - Consider the availability and quality of data on additional outcomes such as diagnosis of depression, quality of life, and social functioning.\n  - Note that available data were not suitable for meta-analysis, highlighting potential gaps in evidence.\n\nEach bullet point represents a key criterion to be used when evaluating the results of pharmacy-based management interventions for depression in adults, taking into account both the effectiveness and acceptability of the intervention."

    "query": "Title: Pharmacological interventions for treatment‐resistant depression in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAlthough antidepressants are often a first‐line treatment for adults with moderate to severe depression, many people do not respond adequately to medication, and are said to have treatment��resistant depression (TRD). Little evidence exists to inform the most appropriate 'next step' treatment for these people. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effectiveness of standard pharmacological treatments for adults with TRD. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) (March 2016), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science (31 December 2018), the World Health Organization trials portal and ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished and ongoing studies, and screened bibliographies of included studies and relevant systematic reviews without date or language restrictions. \nSelection criteria:\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) with participants aged 18 to 74 years with unipolar depression (based on criteria from DSM‐IV‐TR or earlier versions, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐10, Feighner criteria or Research Diagnostic Criteria) who had not responded to a minimum of four weeks of antidepressant treatment at a recommended dose. Interventions were: (1) increasing the dose of antidepressant monotherapy; (2) switching to a different antidepressant monotherapy; (3) augmenting treatment with another antidepressant; (4) augmenting treatment with a non‐antidepressant. All were compared with continuing antidepressant monotherapy. We excluded studies of non‐standard pharmacological treatments (e.g. sex hormones, vitamins, herbal medicines and food supplements). \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo reviewers used standard Cochrane methods to extract data, assess risk of bias, and resolve disagreements. We analysed continuous outcomes with mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated a relative risk (RR) and 95% CI. Where sufficient data existed, we conducted meta‐analyses using random‐effects models. \nMain results:\nWe included 10 RCTs (2731 participants). Nine were conducted in outpatient settings and one in both in‐ and outpatients. Mean age of participants ranged from 42 ‐ 50.2 years, and most were female. One study investigated switching to, or augmenting current antidepressant treatment with, another antidepressant (mianserin). Another augmented current antidepressant treatment with the antidepressant mirtazapine. Eight studies augmented current antidepressant treatment with a non‐antidepressant (either an anxiolytic (buspirone) or an antipsychotic (cariprazine; olanzapine; quetiapine (3 studies); or ziprasidone (2 studies)). We judged most studies to be at a low or unclear risk of bias. Only one of the included studies was not industry‐sponsored. There was no evidence of a difference in depression severity when current treatment was switched to mianserin (MD on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM‐D) = ‐1.8, 95% CI ‐5.22 to 1.62, low‐quality evidence)) compared with continuing on antidepressant monotherapy. Nor was there evidence of a difference in numbers dropping out of treatment (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.59, low‐quality evidence; dropouts 38% in the mianserin switch group; 18% in the control). Augmenting current antidepressant treatment with mianserin was associated with an improvement in depression symptoms severity scores from baseline (MD on HAM‐D ‐4.8, 95% CI ‐8.18 to ‐1.42; moderate‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in numbers dropping out (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.72; low‐quality evidence; 19% dropouts in the mianserin‐augmented group; 38% in the control). When current antidepressant treatment was augmented with mirtazapine, there was little difference in depressive symptoms (MD on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI‐II) ‐1.7, 95% CI ‐4.03 to 0.63; high‐quality evidence) and no evidence of a difference in dropout numbers (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.62; dropouts 2% in mirtazapine‐augmented group; 3% in the control). Augmentation with buspirone provided no evidence of a benefit in terms of a reduction in depressive symptoms (MD on Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ‐0.30, 95% CI ‐9.48 to 8.88; low‐quality evidence) or numbers of drop‐outs (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.53; low‐quality evidence; dropouts 11% in buspirone‐augmented group; 19% in the control). Severity of depressive symptoms reduced when current treatment was augmented with cariprazine (MD on MADRS ‐1.50, 95% CI ‐2.74 to ‐0.25; high‐quality evidence), olanzapine (MD on HAM‐D ‐7.9, 95% CI ‐16.76 to 0.96; low‐quality evidence; MD on MADRS ‐12.4, 95% CI ‐22.44 to ‐2.36; low‐quality evidence), quetiapine (SMD ‐0.32, 95% CI ‐0.46 to ‐0.18; I2 = 6%, high‐quality evidence), or ziprasidone (MD on HAM‐D ‐2.73, 95% CI ‐4.53 to ‐0.93; I2 = 0, moderate‐quality evidence) compared with continuing on antidepressant monotherapy. However, a greater number of participants dropped out when antidepressant monotherapy was augmented with an antipsychotic (cariprazine RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.41; quetiapine RR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.17; ziprasidone RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.55) compared with antidepressant monotherapy, although estimates for olanzapine augmentation were imprecise (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.69). Dropout rates ranged from 10% to 39% in the groups augmented with an antipsychotic, and from 12% to 23% in the comparison groups. The most common reasons for dropping out were side effects or adverse events. We also summarised data about response and remission rates (based on changes in depressive symptoms) for included studies, along with data on social adjustment and social functioning, quality of life, economic outcomes and adverse events. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nA small body of evidence shows that augmenting current antidepressant therapy with mianserin or with an antipsychotic (cariprazine, olanzapine, quetiapine or ziprasidone) improves depressive symptoms over the short‐term (8 to 12 weeks). However, this evidence is mostly of low or moderate quality due to imprecision of the estimates of effects. Improvements with antipsychotics need to be balanced against the increased likelihood of dropping out of treatment or experiencing an adverse event. Augmentation of current antidepressant therapy with a second antidepressant, mirtazapine, does not produce a clinically important benefit in reduction of depressive symptoms (high‐quality evidence). The evidence regarding the effects of augmenting current antidepressant therapy with buspirone or switching current antidepressant treatment to mianserin is currently insufficient. Further trials are needed to increase the certainty of these findings and to examine long‐term effects of treatment, as well as the effectiveness of other pharmacological treatment strategies.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Augmentation with Mianserin or Antipsychotics:**\n  - Short-term (8–12 weeks) improvement in depressive symptoms observed with augmentation using mianserin or antipsychotics (cariprazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone).\n  - Evidence quality for improvement in depressive symptoms is mostly low or moderate, due to imprecise effect estimates.\n  - Consider increased likelihood of treatment dropouts or adverse events when using antipsychotics.\n\n- **Mirtazapine Augmentation:**\n  - No clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms when augmenting with mirtazapine.\n  - High-quality evidence supports the lack of substantial benefit from mirtazapine augmentation.\n\n- **Buspirone Augmentation and Mianserin Switching:**\n  - Insufficient evidence exists to support the effectiveness of augmenting current antidepressant therapy with buspirone.\n  - Insufficient evidence regarding switching current antidepressant treatment to mianserin.\n\n- **Dropout Rates and Adverse Effects:**\n  - Antipsychotic augmentation associated with higher dropout rates, primarily due to side effects or adverse events.\n  - Dropout considerations are critical in determining the balance between potential benefits and risks.\n\n- **Evidence Limitations and Needs:**\n  - Current evidence is limited and mostly low to moderate in quality, necessitating further research.\n  - Need for trials exploring long-term effects and other pharmacological treatment strategies.\n\n- **Clinical Implications:**\n  - Clinicians should weigh short-term benefits of augmentation strategies against potential adverse outcomes.\n  - Decision-making should consider the high dropout rates and quality of evidence available.\n"

    "query": "Title: Modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPeople with schizophrenia have a range of different symptoms, including positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal and lack of affect), and cognitive impairment. The standard medication for people with schizophrenia is antipsychotics. However, these medications may not be effective for all symptoms of schizophrenia, as cognitive and negative symptoms are usually hard to treat. Additional therapies or medications are available for the management of these symptoms. Modafinil, a wakefulness‐promoting agent most frequently used in narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder, is one intervention that is theorised to have an effect of these symptoms. \nObjectives:\nThe primary objective of this review was to assess the effects of modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. \nSearch methods:\nOn 27 April 2015, 24 May 2017, and 31 October 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials, which is based on regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for the inclusion of records in the register. \nSelection criteria:\nWe selected all randomised controlled trials comparing modafinil with placebo or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe independently extracted data from the included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. We used a random‐effects model for the meta‐analysis. We used GRADE to complete a 'Summary of findings' table and assessed risk of bias for the included studies. \nMain results:\nEleven studies including a total of 422 participants contributed to data analyses. Most studies had a small population size (average 38 people per study) and were of short duration. We also detected a high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting in just under 50% of the trials. We therefore rated the overall methodological quality of the included studies as low. We considered seven main outcomes of interest: clinically important change in overall mental state, clinically important change in cognitive functioning, incidence of a clinically important adverse effect/event, clinically important change in global state, leaving the study early for any reason, clinically important change in quality of life, and hospital admission. All studies assessed the effects of adding modafinil to participants' usual antipsychotic treatment compared to adding placebo to usual antipsychotic treatment. Six studies found that adding modafinil to antipsychotic treatment may have little or no effect on overall mental state of people with schizophrenia, specifically the risk of worsening psychosis (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.98; participants = 209; studies = 6,  low‐quality evidence ). Regarding the effect of modafinil on cognitive function, the trials did not report clinically important change data, but one study reported endpoint scores on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB): in this study we found no clear difference in scores between modafinil and placebo treatment groups (MD −3.10, 95% CI −10.9 to 4.7; participants = 48; studies = 1,  very low‐quality evidence ). Only one study (N = 35) reported adverse effect/event data. In this study one serious adverse event occurred in each group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42; participants = 35; studies = 1,  very low‐quality evidence ). One study measured change in global state using the Clinical Global Impression ‐ Improvement Scale. This study found that adding modafinil to antipsychotic treatment may have little or no effect on global state (RR 6.36, 95% CI 0.94 to 43.07, participants = 21; studies = 1,  very low‐quality evidence ). Nine studies found that modafinil has no effect on numbers of participants leaving the study early (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.52 participants = 357; studies = 9,  moderate‐quality evidence ). None of the trials reported clinically important change in quality of life, but one study did report quality of life using endpoint scores on the Quality of Life Inventory, finding no clear difference between treatment groups (MD −0.2, 95% CI −1.18 to 0.78; participants = 20; studies = 1,  very low‐quality evidence ). Finally, one study reported data for number of participants needing hospitalisation: one participant in each group was hospitalised (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42; participants = 35; studies = 1,  very low‐quality evidence ). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nDue to methodological issues, low sample size, and short duration of the clinical trials as well as high risk of bias for outcome reporting, most of the evidence available for this review is of very low or low quality. For results where quality is low or very low, we are uncertain or very uncertain if the effect estimates are true effects, limiting our conclusions. Specifically, we found that modafinil is no better or worse than placebo at preventing worsening of psychosis; however, we are uncertain about this result. We have more confidence that participants receiving modafinil are no more likely to leave a trial early than participants receiving placebo. However, we are very uncertain about the remaining equivocal results between modafinil and placebo for outcomes such as improvement in global state or cognitive function, incidence of adverse events, and changes in quality of life. More high‐quality data are needed before firm conclusions regarding the effects of modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders can be made.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the abstract and the main findings, a complete set of scoring reference points for evaluating the effects of modafinil in the study would include:\n\n- **Clinically Important Change in Overall Mental State:**\n  - Score if modafinil shows little to no effect in preventing worsening psychosis in comparison to placebo.\n  - Reference Risk Ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.98 (low-quality evidence).\n\n- **Clinically Important Change in Cognitive Functioning:**\n  - Score if modafinil shows no clear difference in cognitive function scores in comparison to placebo.\n  - Reference Mean Difference (MD) -3.10, 95% CI -10.9 to 4.7 (very low-quality evidence).\n\n- **Incidence of Clinically Important Adverse Effect/Event:**\n  - Score if there is no clear difference between modafinil and placebo on adverse effects reporting.\n  - Reference RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42 (very low-quality evidence).\n\n- **Clinically Important Change in Global State:**\n  - Score if modafinil shows little to no effect on global state compared to placebo.\n  - Reference RR 6.36, 95% CI 0.94 to 43.07 (very low-quality evidence).\n\n- **Leaving the Study Early for Any Reason:**\n  - Score if participants receiving modafinil are no more likely to leave the study early than those receiving placebo.\n  - Reference RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.52 (moderate-quality evidence).\n\n- **Clinically Important Change in Quality of Life:**\n  - Score if there is no clear difference between modafinil and placebo in terms of quality of life scores.\n  - Reference MD -0.2, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.78 (very low-quality evidence).\n\n- **Hospital Admission:**\n  - Score if modafinil does not increase the likelihood of hospitalization compared to placebo.\n  - Reference RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42 (very low-quality evidence).\n\nThe scoring should reflect the overall low to very low methodological quality and high uncertainty in the outcomes due to small sample sizes and study biases."

    "query": "Title: Psychosocial interventions for people with both severe mental illness and substance misuse\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nEven low levels of substance misuse by people with a severe mental illness can have detrimental effects. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for reduction in substance use in people with a serious mental illness compared with standard care. \nSearch methods:\nThe Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (CSG) searched the CSG Trials Register (2 May 2018), which is based on regular searches of major medical and scientific databases. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocial interventions for substance misuse with standard care in people with serious mental illness. \nData collection and analysis:\nReview authors independently selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. Where meta‐analyses were possible, we pooled data using a random‐effects model. Using the GRADE approach, we identified seven patient‐centred outcomes and assessed the quality of evidence for these within each comparison. \nMain results:\nOur review now includes 41 trials with a total of 4024 participants. We have identified nine comparisons within the included trials and present a summary of our main findings for seven of these below. We were unable to summarise many findings due to skewed data or because trials did not measure the outcome of interest. In general, evidence was rated as low‐ or very‐low quality due to high or unclear risks of bias because of poor trial methods, or inadequately reported methods, and imprecision due to small sample sizes, low event rates and wide confidence intervals. 1. Integrated models of care versus standard care (36 months) No clear differences were found between treatment groups for loss to treatment (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.45; participants = 603; studies = 3; low‐quality evidence), death (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.57; participants = 421; studies = 2; low‐quality evidence), alcohol use (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.56; participants = 143; studies = 1; low‐quality evidence), substance use (drug) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25; participants = 85; studies = 1; low‐quality evidence), global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores (MD 0.40, 95% CI ‐2.47 to 3.27; participants = 170; studies = 1; low‐quality evidence), or general life satisfaction (QOLI) scores (MD 0.10, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.38; participants = 373; studies = 2; moderate‐quality evidence). 2. Non‐integrated models of care versus standard care There was no clear difference between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment at 12 months (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; participants = 134; studies = 3; very low‐quality evidence). 3. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus standard care There was no clear difference between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment at three months (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.86; participants = 152; studies = 2; low‐quality evidence), cannabis use at six months (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.15; participants = 47; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence) or mental state insight (IS) scores by three months (MD 0.52, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 1.82; participants = 105; studies = 1; low‐quality evidence). 4. Contingency management versus standard care We found no clear differences between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment at three months (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.11; participants = 255; studies = 2; moderate‐quality evidence), number of stimulant positive urine tests at six months (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06; participants = 176; studies = 1) or hospitalisations (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.93; participants = 176; studies = 1); both low‐quality evidence . 5. Motivational interviewing (MI) versus standard care We found no clear differences between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment at six months (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.63 to 4.64; participants = 62; studies = 1). A clear difference, favouring MI, was observed for abstaining from alcohol (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; participants = 28; studies = 1) but not other substances (MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.56 to 0.42; participants = 89; studies = 1), and no differences were observed in mental state general severity (SCL‐90‐R) scores (MD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.21; participants = 30; studies = 1). All very low‐quality evidence. 6. Skills training versus standard care At 12 months, there were no clear differences between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 10.10; participants = 122; studies = 3) or death (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.42; participants = 121; studies = 1) .  Very low‐quality, and low‐quality evidence, respectively. 7. CBT + MI versus standard care At 12 months, there was no clear difference between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.59; participants = 327; studies = 1; low‐quality evidence), number of deaths (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.76; participants = 603; studies = 4; low‐quality evidence), relapse (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04; participants = 36; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence), or GAF scores (MD 1.24, 95% CI ‐1.86 to 4.34; participants = 445; studies = 4; very low‐quality evidence). There was also no clear difference in reduction of drug use by six months (MD 0.19, 95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.60; participants = 119; studies = 1; low‐quality evidence). \nAuthors' conclusions:\nWe included 41 RCTs but were unable to use much data for analyses. There is currently no high‐quality evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over standard care for important outcomes such as remaining in treatment, reduction in substance use or improving mental or global state in people with serious mental illnesses and substance misuse. Furthermore, methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results. Further high‐quality trials are required which address these concerns and improve the evidence in this important area.",

    "query": "Title: Psychosocial interventions for preventing and treating depression in dialysis patients\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPeople with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) treated with dialysis are frequently affected by major depression. Dialysis patients have prioritised depression as a critically important clinical outcome in nephrology trials. Psychological and social support are potential treatments for depression, although a Cochrane review in 2005 identified zero eligible studies. This is an update of the Cochrane review first published in 2005. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effect of using psychosocial interventions versus usual care or a second psychosocial intervention for preventing and treating depression in patients with ESKD treated with dialysis. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Register of Studies up to 21 June 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of psychosocial interventions for prevention and treatment of depression among adults treated with long‐term dialysis. We assessed effects of interventions on changes in mental state (depression, anxiety, cognition), suicide, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), withdrawal from dialysis treatment, withdrawal from intervention, death (any cause), hospitalisation and adverse events. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We applied the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias' tool and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty. We estimated treatment effects using random‐effects meta‐analysis. Results for continuous outcomes were expressed as a mean difference (MD) or as a standardised mean difference (SMD) when investigators used different scales. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios. All estimates were reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CI). \nMain results:\nWe included 33 studies enrolling 2056 participants. Twenty‐six new studies were added to this 2019 update. Seven studies originally excluded from the 2005 review were included as they met the updated review eligibility criteria, which have been expanded to include RCTs in which participants did not meet criteria for depression as an inclusion criterion. Psychosocial interventions included acupressure, cognitive‐behavioural therapy, counselling, education, exercise, meditation, motivational interviewing, relaxation techniques, social activity, spiritual practices, support groups, telephone support, visualisation, and voice‐recording of a psychological intervention. The duration of study follow‐up ranged between three weeks and one year. Studies included between nine and 235 participants. The mean study age ranged between 36.1 and 73.9 years. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in eight and one studies respectively. One study reported low risk methods for blinding of participants and investigators, and outcome assessment was blinded in seven studies. Twelve studies were at low risk of attrition bias, eight studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias, and 21 studies were at low risk of other potential sources of bias. Cognitive behavioural therapy probably improves depressive symptoms measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (4 studies, 230 participants: MD ‐6.10, 95% CI ‐8.63 to ‐3.57), based on moderate certainty evidence. Cognitive behavioural therapy compared to usual care probably improves HRQoL measured either with the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form or the Quality of Life Scale, with a 0.5 standardised mean difference representing a moderate effect size (4 studies, 230 participants: SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.83) , based on moderate certainty evidence. Cognitive behavioural therapy may reduce major depression symptoms (one study) and anxiety, and increase self‐efficacy (one study). Cognitive behavioural therapy studies did not report hospitalisation. We found low‐certainty evidence that counselling may slightly reduce depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (3 studies, 99 participants: MD ‐3.84, 95% CI ‐6.14 to ‐1.53) compared to usual care. Counselling reported no difference in HRQoL (one study). Counselling studies did not measure risk of major depression, suicide, or hospitalisation. Exercise may reduce or prevent major depression (3 studies, 108 participants: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.81), depression of any severity (3 studies, 108 participants: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.87) and improve HRQoL measured with Quality of Life Index score (2 studies, 64 participants: MD 3.06, 95% CI 2.29 to 3.83) compared to usual care with low certainty. With moderate certainty, exercise probably improves depression symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (3 studies, 108 participants: MD ‐7.61, 95% CI ‐9.59 to ‐5.63). Exercise may reduce anxiety (one study). No exercise studies measured suicide risk or withdrawal from dialysis. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that relaxation techniques probably reduce depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (2 studies, 122 participants: MD ‐5.77, 95% CI ‐8.76 to ‐2.78). Relaxation techniques reported no difference in HRQoL (one study). Relaxation studies did not measure risk of major depression or suicide. Spiritual practices have uncertain effects on depressive symptoms measured either with the Beck Depression Inventory or the Brief Symptom Inventory (2 studies, 116 participants: SMD ‐1.00, 95% CI ‐3.52 to 1.53; very low certainty evidence). No differences between spiritual practices and usual care were reported on anxiety (one study), and HRQoL (one study). No study of spiritual practices evaluated effects on suicide risk, withdrawal from dialysis or hospitalisation. There were few or no data on acupressure, telephone support, meditation and adverse events related to psychosocial interventions. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nCognitive behavioural therapy, exercise or relaxation techniques probably reduce depressive symptoms (moderate‐certainty evidence) for adults with ESKD treated with dialysis. Cognitive behavioural therapy probably increases health‐related quality of life. Evidence for spiritual practices, acupressure, telephone support, and meditation is of low certainty . Similarly, evidence for effects of psychosocial interventions on suicide risk, major depression, hospitalisation, withdrawal from dialysis, and adverse events is of low or very low certainty.",
    "reference_answer": "Based on the main findings and the full-score interpretations provided, here is a complete set of scoring reference points for the main findings of this study:\n\n- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**\n  - Demonstrates probable improvement in depressive symptoms with moderate-certainty evidence.\n  - Probably increases health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Exercise:**\n  - Probably reduces symptoms of major depression with moderate-certainty evidence.\n  - Probably improves HRQoL, but with low-certainty regarding some specific aspects.\n  - Probably reduces depressive symptoms with moderate-certainty evidence.\n  - May reduce or prevent major depression.\n\n- **Relaxation Techniques:**\n  - Likely reduce depressive symptoms with moderate-certainty evidence.\n\n- **Counseling:**\n  - May offer a slight reduction in depressive symptoms with low-certainty evidence.\n  - Did not demonstrate significant change in HRQoL.\n\n- **Spiritual Practices:**\n  - Showed very low certainty regarding the impact on depressive symptoms.\n  - Results concerning HRQoL were unclear and uncertain.\n  \n- **Other Psychosocial Interventions (acupressure, telephone support, meditation):**\n  - Evidence available is of low certainty or insufficient to make definitive conclusions.\n\nIn summary, cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, and relaxation techniques have moderately certain evidence supporting their efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms in dialysis patients, while other interventions like spiritual practices and counseling show low or very low certainty in improving depressive symptoms and HRQoL."

    "query": "Title: Psychological interventions for co‐occurring depression and substance use disorders\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nComorbid depression and substance use disorders are common and have poorer outcomes than either disorder alone. While effective psychological treatments for depression or substance use disorders are available, relatively few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the efficacy of these treatments in people with these comorbid disorders. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the efficacy of psychological interventions delivered alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy for people diagnosed with comorbid depression and substance use disorders. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the following databases up to February 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar and clinical trials registers. All systematic reviews identified, were handsearched for relevant articles. \nSelection criteria:\nThe review includes data from RCTs of psychological treatments for people diagnosed with comorbid depression and substance use disorders, using structured clinical interviews. Studies were included if some of the sample were experiencing another mental health disorder (e.g. anxiety); however, studies which required a third disorder as part of their inclusion criteria were not included. Studies were included if psychological interventions (with or without pharmacotherapy) were compared with no treatment, delayed treatment, treatment as usual or other psychological treatments. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. \nMain results:\nSeven RCTs of psychological treatments with a total of 608 participants met inclusion criteria. All studies were published in the USA and predominately consisted of Caucasian samples. All studies compared different types of psychological treatments. Two studies compared Integrated Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (ICBT) with Twelve Step Facilitation (TSF), another two studies compared Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depression (IPT‐D) with other treatment (Brief Supportive Therapy (BST) or Psychoeducation). The other three studies compared different types or combinations of psychological treatments. No studies compared psychological interventions with no treatment or treatment as usual control conditions. The studies included a diverse range of participants (e.g. veterans, prisoners, community adults and adolescents). All studies were at high risk of performance bias, other main sources were selection, outcome detection and attrition bias. Due to heterogeneity between studies only two meta‐analyses were conducted. The first meta‐analysis focused on two studies (296 participants) comparing ICBT to TSF. Very low‐quality evidence revealed that while the TSF group had lower depression scores than the ICBT group at post‐treatment (mean difference (MD) 4.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 6.66; 212 participants), there was no difference between groups in depression symptoms (MD 1.53, 95% CI ‐1.73 to 4.79; 181 participants) at six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up. At post‐treatment there was no difference between groups in proportion of days abstinent (MD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐8.04 to 2.35; 220 participants), however, the ICBT group had a greater proportion of days abstinent than the TSF group at the six‐ to 12‐month follow‐up (MD 10.76, 95% CI 3.10 to 18.42; 189 participants). There were no differences between the groups in treatment attendance (MD ‐1.27, 95% CI ‐6.10 to 3.56; 270 participants) or treatment retention (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.25; 296 participants). The second meta‐analysis was conducted with two studies (64 participants) comparing IPT‐D with other treatment (Brief Supportive Psychotherapy/Psychoeducation). Very low‐quality evidence indicated IPT‐D resulted in significantly lower depressive symptoms at post‐treatment (MD ‐0.54, 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.04; 64 participants), but this effect was not maintained at three‐month follow‐up (MD 3.80, 95% CI ‐3.83 to 11.43) in the one study reporting follow‐up outcomes (38 participants; IPT‐D versus Psychoeducation). Substance use was examined separately in each study, due to heterogeneity in outcomes. Both studies found very low‐quality evidence of no significant differences in substance use outcomes at post‐treatment (percentage of days abstinent, IPD versus Brief Supportive Psychotherapy; MD ‐2.70, 95% CI ‐28.74 to 23.34; 26 participants) or at three‐month follow‐up (relative risk of relapse, IPT‐D versus Psychoeducation; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50; 38 participants). There was also very low‐quality evidence for no significant differences between groups in treatment retention (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.23; 64 participants). No adverse events were reported in any study. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nThe conclusions of this review are limited due to the low number and very poor quality of included studies. No conclusions can be made about the efficacy of psychological interventions (delivered alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy) for the treatment of comorbid depression and substance use disorders, as they are yet to be compared with no treatment or treatment as usual in this population. In terms of differences between psychotherapies, although some significant effects were found, the effects were too inconsistent and small, and the evidence of too poor quality, to be of relevance to practice.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Quality of Evidence**\n  - The studies included in the review are of very low quality with a high risk of bias.\n  - Due to poor quality, the findings are not reliable for guiding clinical practice.\n\n- **Intervention Comparison: ICBT vs. TSF**\n  - Post-treatment, TSF showed lower depression scores compared to ICBT.\n  - At six- to 12-month follow-up, no significant difference in depression symptoms between ICBT and TSF.\n  - ICBT had a greater proportion of days abstinent at six- to 12-month follow-up compared to TSF.\n\n- **Intervention Comparison: IPT-D vs. Other Treatments (BST/Psychoeducation)**\n  - IPT-D showed lower depressive symptoms post-treatment compared to other treatments.\n  - The reduced depressive symptoms with IPT-D were not maintained at three-month follow-up.\n  - No significant differences in substance use outcomes between IPT-D and other treatments.\n\n- **General Outcomes Across Studies**\n  - No significant differences found in treatment attendance or treatment retention between different psychological treatments.\n  - No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.\n\n- **Overall Efficacy and Practical Relevance**\n  - Psychological interventions for comorbid depression and substance use disorders have inconsistent and small effects.\n  - Due to the limited number and poor quality of studies, no conclusive findings can be made regarding the efficacy of these treatments."

    "query": "Title: Present‐centered therapy (PCT) for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nPresent‐centered therapy (PCT) is a non‐trauma, manualized psychotherapy for adults with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PCT was originally designed as a treatment comparator in trials evaluating the effectiveness of trauma‐focused cognitive‐behavioral therapy (TF‐CBT). Recent trials have indicated that PCT may be an effective treatment option for PTSD and that patients may drop out of PCT at lower rates relative to TF‐CBT. \nObjectives:\nTo assess the effects of PCT for adults with PTSD. Specifically, we sought to determine whether (1) PCT is more effective in alleviating symptoms relative to control conditions, (2) PCT results in similar alleviation of symptoms compared to TF‐CBT, based on an a priori minimally important differences on a semi‐structured interview of PTSD symptoms, and (3) PCT is associated with lower treatment dropout as compared to TF‐CBT. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and PTSDpubs (previously called the Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) database) (all years to 15 February 2019 search). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were checked. Grey literature searches were also conducted to identify dissertations and theses, clinical guidelines, and regulatory agency reports. \nSelection criteria:\nWe selected all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that recruited adults diagnosed with PTSD to evaluate PCT compared to TF‐CBT or a control condition. Both individual and group PCT modalities were included. The primary outcomes of interest included reduced PTSD severity as determined by a clinician‐administered measure and treatment dropout rates. \nData collection and analysis:\nWe complied with the Cochrane recommended standards for data screening and collection. Two review authors independently screened articles for inclusion and extracted relevant data from eligible studies, including the assessment of trial quality. Random‐effects meta‐analyses, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using mean differences (MD) and standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous data or risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) for dichotomous data. To conclude that PCT resulted in similar reductions in PTSD symptoms relative to TF‐CBT, we required a MD of less than 10 points (to include the 95% confidence interval) on the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Five members of the review team convened to rate the quality of evidence across the primary outcomes. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Review authors who were investigators on any of the included trials were not involved in the qualitative or quantitative syntheses. \nMain results:\nWe included 12 studies (n = 1837), of which, three compared PCT to a wait‐list/minimal attention (WL/MA) group and 11 compared PCT to TF‐CBT. PCT was more effective than WL/MA in reducing PTSD symptom severity (SMD ‐0.84, 95% CI ‐1.10 to ‐0.59; participants = 290; studies = 3; I² = 0%). We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate. The results of the non‐inferiority analysis comparing PCT to TF‐CBT did not support PCT non‐inferiority, with the 95% confidence interval surpassing the clinically meaningful  c ut‐off (MD 6.83, 95% CI 1.90 to 11.76; 6 studies, n = 607; I² = 42%). We assessed this quality of evidence as low. CAPS differences between PCT and TF‐CBT attenuated at 6‐month (MD 1.59, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 3.63; participants = 906; studies = 6; I² = 0%) and 12‐month (MD 1.22, 95% CI ‐2.17 to 4.61; participants = 485; studies = 3; I² = 0%) follow‐up periods. To confirm the direction of the treatment effect using all eligible trials, we also evaluated PTSD SMD differences. These results were consistent with the primary MD outcomes, with meaningful effect size differences between PCT and TF‐CBT at post‐treatment (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.56; participants = 1129; studies = 9), but smaller effect size differences at six months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.29; participants = 1339; studies = 9) and 12 months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.31; participants = 728; studies = 5). PCT had approximately 14% lower treatment dropout rates compared to TF‐CBT (RD ‐0.14, 95% CI ‐0.18 to ‐0.10; participants = 1542; studies = 10). We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate. There was no evidence of meaningful differences on self‐reported PTSD (MD 4.50, 95% CI 3.09 to 5.90; participants = 983; studies = 7) or depression symptoms (MD 1.78, 95% CI ‐0.23 to 3.78; participants = 705; studies = 5) post‐treatment. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nModerate‐quality evidence indicates that PCT is more effective in reducing PTSD severity compared to control conditions. Low quality of evidence did not support PCT as a non‐inferior treatment compared to TF‐CBT on clinician‐rated post‐treatment PTSD severity. The treatment effect differences between PCT and TF‐CBT may attenuate over time. PCT participants drop out of treatment at lower rates relative to TF‐CBT participants. Of note, all of the included studies were primarily designed to test the effectiveness of TF‐CBT which may bias results away from PCT non‐inferiority.The current systematic review provides the most rigorous evaluation to date to determine whether PCT is comparably as effective as TF‐CBT. Findings are generally consistent with current clinical practice guidelines that suggest that PCT may be offered as a treatment for PTSD when TF‐CBT is not available.",
    "reference_answer": "To develop a comprehensive scoring reference for the main findings of the Present‐Centered Therapy (PCT) study for PTSD, we can derive scoring criteria based on the models outlined. Here are the essential scoring points:\n\n- **Effectiveness Against Control Conditions**\n  - PCT's effectiveness in reducing PTSD severity compared to wait-list/minimal attention groups should be assessed with an emphasis on the standardized mean difference (SMD -0.84, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.59). \n  - Evidence quality must be considered moderate for this criterion.\n\n- **Non-Inferiority Compared to TF-CBT**\n  - Assess PCT's inability to demonstrate non-inferiority to trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) in reducing clinician-rated PTSD symptom severity using the mean difference (MD 6.83, 95% CI 1.90 to 11.76).\n  - Evidence quality should be rated as low, emphasizing the non-inferiority aspect.\n\n- **Attenuation of Treatment Effect**\n  - Evaluate whether the differences in effectiveness between PCT and TF-CBT decrease over time, particularly at 6-month (MD 1.59, 95% CI -0.46 to 3.63) and 12-month (MD 1.22, 95% CI -2.17 to 4.61) follow-ups.\n  - Consider evidence that supports reduced effect size differences over these periods.\n\n- **Treatment Dropout Rates**\n  - PCT's treatment dropout rates should be scored based on risk differences (RD -0.14, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.10), considering approximately 14% lower dropout compared to TF-CBT.\n  - Evidence quality should be rated as moderate for dropout rate assessments.\n\n- **Self-Reported Outcomes**\n  - Consider the absence of significant differences on self-reported PTSD (MD 4.50, 95% CI 3.09 to 5.90) and depression symptoms (MD 1.78, 95% CI -0.23 to 3.78) post-treatment.\n  - This criterion should incorporate the overall lack of significant effect in self-reported measures.\n\nEach of these points forms a critical scoring criterion for assessing the main findings on PCT effectiveness relative to other conditions and treatments in adults with PTSD."

    "query": "Title: Cerebrolysin for vascular dementia\nAbstract: \nBackground:\nAlthough vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia globally, evidence‐based treatments are still lacking. Cerebrolysin is a porcine brain‐derived preparation that is said to have neurotrophic and neuroprotective activity. In many parts of the world Cerebrolysin, given as a series of daily intravenous infusions, is used as a potential intervention for vascular dementia. A previous Cochrane Review on Cerebrolysin in vascular dementia yielded inconsistent results. We wished to update the review to add new studies from the international literature and employ contemporary methods for appraising the strength of the evidence. This is the first update of a review first published in 2013. \nObjectives:\nPrimary: to assess the effect of Cerebrolysin on cognitive function, global function, and all‐cause mortality in people living with vascular dementia. Secondary: to assess the adverse effects of Cerebrolysin and to assess the effect of Cerebrolysin on quality of life and caregiver burden. \nSearch methods:\nWe searched ALOIS, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ISI Web of Knowledge, LILACS, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP on 16 June 2017, 9 May 2018, and 9 May 2019. We expanded the search by adding four Chinese databases, searched from 1 January 2012 to 19 May 2019. We checked bibliographies of relevant papers identified and contacted pharmaceutical companies, trial authors, and experts in the field to identify any additional published or unpublished data. \nSelection criteria:\nWe included all randomised controlled trials of Cerebrolysin used in people living with vascular dementia. We applied no language restriction. \nData collection and analysis:\nTwo review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and evaluated their methodological quality. Data were extracted and analysed using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for continuous outcomes. We reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We assessed the strength of the available evidence using the GRADE approach. \nMain results:\nWe identified six randomised controlled trials with a total of 597 participants that were eligible for inclusion in the 2013 review. No new studies were eligible for inclusion in this update. Participants in the included studies, where dementia severity was reported, had mild to moderate severity of vascular dementia (four trials). The included studies tested varying doses and duration of Cerebrolysin treatment. Follow‐up ranged from 15 days to three years. Five of included studies were conducted in China (three studies), Russia (one study), and Romania (one study), while relevant information of other study was unclear. Where details of funding were available, all studies were supported by the pharmaceutical industry (three studies). Cognitive function was measured using the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subpart, extended version (ADAS‐cog+). Combining the MMSE and ADAS‐cog+ data (three studies, 420 people), there was a beneficial effect of Cerebrolysin (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.58; very low‐quality evidence). Global function was measured by Clinician's Interview‐Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC+) or Investigator's Clinical Global Impression (CGI). We assessed response rates on these measures (the proportion of participants with a CIBIC+ score of < 3; or at least moderate improvement of the CGI rating at the last visit). There was a beneficial effect of Cerebrolysin (two studies, 379 participants, RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.82 to 3.98; very low‐quality evidence). Only one trial described mortality and reported no deaths. Four studies reported adverse events; data from two studies (379 people) were in a format that permitted meta‐analysis, and there was no difference in rates of adverse effects (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.85; very low‐quality evidence). No studies reported on quality of life or caregiver burden. \nAuthors' conclusions:\nCourses of intravenous Cerebrolysin improved cognition and general function in people living with vascular dementia, with no suggestion of adverse effects. However, these data are not definitive. Our analyses were limited by heterogeneity, and the included papers had high risk of bias. If there are benefits of Cerebrolysin, the effects may be too small to be clinically meaningful. There have been no new studies of Cerebrolysin in vascular dementia since the last Cochrane Review. Cerebrolysin continues to be used and promoted as a treatment for vascular dementia, but the supporting evidence base is weak. Adequately powered, methodologically robust trials are needed to properly assess the effects of Cerebrolysin in vascular dementia.",
    "reference_answer": "- **Cognitive Function Improvement:**\n  - Cerebrolysin showed improvement in cognitive function, with an effect size of SMD 0.36 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.58) based on combining MMSE and ADAS-cog+ data. Evidence quality was rated as very low.\n\n- **Global Function Improvement:**\n  - The treatment demonstrated an improvement in global function, as indicated by response rates measured with CIBIC+ or CGI scores. The effect size was RR 2.69 (95% CI 1.82 to 3.98) from two studies with 379 participants, with evidence quality assessed as very low.\n\n- **Adverse Effects:**\n  - Analysis indicated no significant difference in adverse effects between Cerebrolysin and control groups, with RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.29 to 2.85). This finding was also supported by very low-quality evidence.\n\n- **Quality of Life and Caregiver Burden:**\n  - No studies provided data on the impact of Cerebrolysin on quality of life or caregiver burden, indicating a gap in the research.\n\n- **General Considerations:**\n  - The evidence base was characterized by high heterogeneity and potential bias, with all included studies being funded by the pharmaceutical industry.\n  - There is an acknowledged need for more robust and adequately powered trials to fully assess the clinical efficacy and safety of Cerebrolysin in treating vascular dementia."
