        "query": "Suicidal Thoughts and Venting I would first like to start off by saying that, if I could, I would not want to die or cease my existence I would want to be happy and not feel like things are crashing down on me, but I can't feel anything besides consistent despair. On the outside, I may look successful. I earned a college degree at the age of 18, and I've worked for UNC, one of the most prestigious public universities in the United States. I have my own apartment at the age of 20, and I have a loving family and a puppy who keeps me company. I am also supposed to be a good Christian girl, and I used to attend the local Coptic church regularly. Beyond my sunny exterior, like I said earlier, I only have dread. I have hated the fact that I have these mean voices in my head telling me that no one truly cares about me. I have hated the fact that I was so insecure about my weight, and have tried to starve myself to stay skinny: if I ate, I would try anything in my power to regurgitate the food that I ate. I have hated the fact that I have stopped attending classes at UNC, going to church, going to therapy, and going to work like I used to. All I can bear to do now is to sell my own body for work, and drink to ease the pain. The reason why? That's the only way I have known to ever feel loved. I was raped since the age of 16 until just recently, and every single day I subconsciously have felt that if no one loves how I look or calls me beautiful that I am worthless. You may ask why I cannot go to my parents or anybody from my church to ask for help. The thing is, I feel as if I don't deserve their help. My parents did not choose to have a daughter like me who has went through so much. People from my church are good people while I am a wretched human being who has done so many horrible things. Besides, I am sure they know that I am not like them. I do all sorts of evil sins, so I would definitely be far from being a good child of God. I am tormented daily. In the morning, by my lack of desire to get up and be productive. At night, by my consistent nightmares. It is all just torture. If I can disappear from existence and not have to experience the pain of death, I would have done it. Right now, I am just trying to decide if disappearing from existence is worth experiencing the pain of death.",

The individual also describes experiencing significant mental and emotional distress, as well as engaging in harmful behaviors such as starving themselves, self-harm, and engaging in risky behaviors.

Just sharing an experience. I attended my first guided meditation session today and found it really helpful. My mind has been racing for days. Just random thoughts pushing out other random thoughts. 25 minutes in a dimly-lit room listening to the soothing voice of someone guiding images was nice. My mind wandered as she read, but she instructed me to acknowledge the thoughts and gently push them away. PTSD tells me not to close my eyes in the room with a stranger; bipolar disorder tells me I can't sit still (mentally or physically) long enough to get through a guided meditation. But get through it I did, and it was very helpful. It was conducted in a little shop in our downtown area and only cost $5. If you're interested in meditation, it might be something to check out in your area. Just my experience.",

        "query": "Social anxiety after sex/masturbation Absolutely hate that this is a thing for me... To sum it up, it's not regular social anxiety. On days where I'm fine, I feel fucking great. Confident, *extremely* social, etc. If anything, I'm naturally more of an outgoing person (esp growing up before this was a thing). But the issue is my social anxiety is more induced after anything sexual. I spoke with a therapist briefly a year back and we did talk a bit about this and she did hypothesize that this is a mental thing (my parents were extremely religious and strict when it came to anything involving girls or sex so I might have internalized that). Anyways so the gist is if I jerk off, then I'm socially anxious that day and the day after. Exact same for sex, if I have sex, then for the day and the day after, I'm also anxious. I have no fucking clue why this is a thing and why it's induced by...essentially ejaculating. Bothers the fuck out of me that such a normal thing for almost every other guy is a thing that gets me socially anxious. It's hard with a girlfriend when sometimes you don't want to have sex if you're doing something social outside just so you won't have anxiety. Or even just jerking off at home but knowing the day after I'll be anxious. What's fucked is I essentially live my life around this. If I know I have a job interview, or I'm going out on say the Wednesday, I'll jerk off or have sex on Saturday (and make sure I do nothing for the 5 days after) so I'm fine socially when the day comes. It's stupid and I don't know if there's even a fix. Alcohol sorta helps and I've tried taking 1mg of Ativan just a test, turns out not even that really did much. Is there a cure, this is seriously impacting my quality of life...",

The individual expresses confusion and frustration about why this occurs and how it impacts their life. The mention of a therapist hypothesizing that this may be a result of internalized messages about sex suggests that there may be underlying anxiety related to this issue.

I'm distraught and just need to vent about my gay boyfriend breakup. We've been together for 16 years, engaged for almost 3 years as of 12/26. The 3 year engagement has really been bugging me this past year and making me question a lot. About a week ago I found several texts messages between him and several other guys. It cut me like a knife, he had one guy to our new home to hook up, another he texted and wished he was laying with him and OUR dog, and another about how when he drives by his house he gets all hot thinking about when they hooked up last. It was so fucking personal/emotional/close to home. I screen shot the texts sent them to my phone, and resent them to my boyfriend, so he knew what I had seen/read. I moved out and got a studio apt. I bought cheap ikea basics. I just bought a package of Hanes shirts, underwear, socks, and haven't been back to our house but a few times while he was working. All my things are still at the house and after 16 years Everything is mingled together. I haven't wanted to tell anyone the exact circumstances of why I left...I'm protecting his image and reputation I guess. I'm starting to second guess my decision because of the history we have. I don't know how I'm going to live without him. He provided a lot financially, and socially many of his friends became our friends, so there isn't anyone I can confide in personally without worry of gossip. Major disruption in many parts of my life that I need to resolve now...I'm going to need better employment to afford my apartment, I have no friends of my own, I'm just so overwhelmed. I'm heart broken leaving my dog at the house...he's my best friend but he deserves a house and yard. Not sure how I'm going to handle the day after Christmas...the anniversary of when I purposed to him. I feel so stupid and I'm mad, but I miss him and I do love him. I feel alone and broken and weak to the core. I'm with family for the holiday and he's alone. I feel sad for him and want to call and tell him I miss Him and I'm sorry. WTF am I sorry for? I'm so confused with these emotions...and I feel guilty for all this for some reason. Arg I'm a mess.",

My girlfriend and I were so so excited and we have some how managed to keep spoiler free up until that night. We parked and on our way to the entrance some lady was talking loud as she could to her husband asking about the movie. Asking why that happened and none of it made sense to her. I just looked at the dude and his wife with my jaw dropped. I was so upset and the dude just looked at me with I am sooo sorry eyes. I get it but at least have the fucking common sense to not talk about the movie WHILE YOU ARE LEAVING THE THEATER. I shrugged it off and thought I'm not going to let this ruin my night and the movie I'll just shove it in the back and forget about it. Well we get our snacks and sit in our seats, the people next to us was a family that worked for our local news station. There was a mother who came just because it was a star wars and her mother. The ad's start and everyone cheers because the movie is about to start. They keep talking, \"Ugh why do they do this to us. I hate sitting through these types of things.\" This is louder than the ads that are playing and everyone can hear them. At one point their sons told them to be quiet because they are going to get \"shh\". The Trailers started and they continued to talk. Talking about the actors in the movies and what was their favorite. Still talking louder then the goddamn trailer. The Avengers trailer starts playing and they just begin to ask all these questions to themselves like who's the guy with the purple skin etc. Then Captain American shows up and they fucking yell, \"whoooo!\" At this point I am thinking they better not fucking talk through this whole thing or I am going to be upset. The movie finally starts and they read the whole text crawl OUT FUCKING LOUD. At this point I am angry and I just looked over and Shh'ed as loud as I could. I've never had to do that. I didn't want to do that, I did anyways and it sucked. It felt like I was doing it to my mom.

I've been having some of the darkest times in my depression lately: crying over everything, moving and talking slowly, not sleeping, suicidal thoughts every night. I told him all this, but at normal appointments, I tend to be very distraught from anxiety. I'm incredible about faking around strangers and can crack a smile and jokes, but normally I can stop this at appointments. Today wasn't one of those days. With the student in the room, I was laughing at his jokes. I was cracking smiles, all while still saying the symptoms I've been facing this past month. I got in my car and instantly broke down in tears, quickly going downhill. I'm scared that he won't believe me, that he will think I was exaggerating and lying for medication (a common fear from every appointment), and generally thinks I'm getting better when I feel the worst I've felt in years. Do you think he probably understands that I was placed in a unique situation where I would instinctively act differently than how I actually felt?

I know from my research cutting out sugar and carbs is a good option because it stabilizes blood sugar. Some sites even suggest cutting out gluten, citing a correlation in improvement after cutting out gluten but not knowing why it helps improve symptoms. I can not even exercise to burn many calories as I am so over weight. I can walk for about 10 minutes, that is providing my mood is good. I go for at least 1, 10 minute walk a day and sometimes up to 5 times a day. Which is nearly an hour of exersise. I am also a college student, but, in my family growing up we relied heavily on pastas, breads, canned and frozen food. I find myself not even knowing how to grocery shopping anymore with all this nutritional advice flying at me. I do not expect my weight to plateau, even if it does I don't want to be 350 pounds.

I really just wanted to move out of my parents house. I knew it was wrong to mislead her but i kept lying to myself about my true feelings. I actually said to myself, okay I'll break up with her but I want to have sex again. Or, I don't want to ruin christmas, I want to experience this other thing. I liked being able to say \"my girlfriend\" like it made me look good. I lead this girl on for a year and a half and I couldn't admit it to myself. I appeared to be the sweetest guy. I did nice boyfriend stuff. She met my family, I met hers. I gave every impression of being a legitimate good guy. I finally couldn't take being unhappy anymore, so I thought I would just end it and we'd both go our separate ways like nothing had happened. We had actually almost broken up once before because I told her I didn't feel comfortable having sex because of my faith. My faith is a sham. And I'm a hypocrite. My life is basically ruined. My parents are very religious, they are christians, and so living with a girl before marriage is definitely a sin and I could see how I was disappointing them and everyone at my church(we actually went to church together). I just said that I didn't feel comfortable living together and basically that she isn't a christian(this is so judgmental of me I wish I could take it back) and that I felt like I was using her to say I had a girlfriend and move out.

I can't live with myself knowing that what I've done may have hurt her in some way. It feels like my empathy and conscious have finally come back online. i've been reading about rape victims and how they can blame themselves and I know she is very independent so i worry she won't reach out for support.

I started to list out the things my father done, since they started earlier(around when I was 7-ish) than my mother's and I believe have been much more impactful: * Made fun of me to the ladies working at a clothing store's changing area because I didn't know how to tie my shoelaces * Yelled at me for spilling a soft drink on my shirt * Yelled at me whenever I got the answer wrong when helping me with math one time * Broke a game's cd rom in front of me because he could not figure out the puzzle * Yelled at me for throwing a soft drink can on the garbage at school because I struggled to open it and was too shy to ask for help * Yelled at me for letting kids at class use my empty water bottle to mix things different drinks in * Grounded me on summer vacation because my cousin was bossing me around but didn't say a word to my cousin or my uncle * Yelled at me in front of extended family in christmas and told me to go to bed early because one of the kids was bossing me around * Never tried to hide that he puts his siblings over us, said christmas without them is not christmas, and once we didn't even celebrated it because my mother wanted just the four of us at home and he got angry about it. Always antagonizes us when he's around his family and makes us feel like burdens and annoyances to them. * Told me I have shit on my head because I forgot to bring a coat when spending a whole day at my friend's house, never mind the fact that it was just two blocks away from mine and my father would drive me back. * Once me and my brother were bickering and I accidentally hit his glasses, he shouted so my father entered the room, yelled and made us sleep early. * When I came out I asked for a gender therapist or just someone with experience with trans patients, he got me a therapist who never had a trans patient before and was obsessed with having me remember the event in my childhood that triggered by dysphoria and dismissed my body issues because \"women have body hair too\" instead of actually helping me. * I found a gender therapist so I gave him her contact info and said I wanted to see her instead, he said he'd call her. Months after I asked him about it, he just tells me she's \"biased\" * Up until I was 18 he'd always force me to get a haircut once my hair was long enough to partially cover my ears, my hair was always thick and hard to manage and he always gave me shit about it. One time he thought I asked the hairdresser to just trim the absolute minimum and went on a fit about how if I wanted to cut my dick off that's fine but he was not going to be a part of it. * To this day he acts like me coming out never happened, the last he commented on it was years ago saying that I should study, find a job and then I can do anything I want to. I opened up despite how painful it was in the time I need his help the most and he just removed himself from that responsibility. * Mocked the way I speak by mimicking me in a tone of voice as if he was imitating a disabled person more than once ﻿* He knows I'm scared of elevators since I'm 5 but always dismissed it, one day as a teen we were on one and the door kept opening and closing, it was fairly crowded with a baby stroller no less, I begged him to let us leave because I was terrified, he then yelled at me in front of everyone and told me he'd never take me out again. * Around the same time we were on a mall's bookstore, he showed me a book but I wasn't interested, partially because of being severely depressed, he flipped at me and ran to the parking area to leave, with the rest of us having to follow him.",

Everyone around me sees me as this smart, happy, upbeat, positive person but all I want to do is be left alone and sleep. I hate being around people. I constantly feel like my life is fucked. I've ruined every opportunity I've had and now I'm 26 with no job and no degree. I tried to get back in school but financial aid and advising seem to try and fuck me at every turn. I jump through hoops for finaid and they do their best to be of as little help as possible. My family looks at me like a fuck up because I'm the only one without a degree and a steady job. I make an effort to smile and joke and seem laid back but really I just wish I didn't exist. Suicide isn't an option because it would hurt too many people around me and I can't have that. Cutting and self harm just seems stupid to me so that's not a worry. I just constantly feel like shit and have hate inside my chest, mostly for myself and the shitty life I've lived. I just want to be one of those guys who pick up and go to another country and start a life in the wilderness or something where nobody will bother me and I won't feel obligated to be a presence in peoples lives.",

I'm twice divorced and facing a third. My oldest child is grown, married and living in China. She has her life. She has her Father, his Wife and her entire family. Although I raised her, I've never quite measured up to what they can and do provide for her. My boys are 16 and 11. Their Father and I were together for 18 years. He was a chronic adulterer. He left me September of 2009 for his 3rd mistress and they are still together. He has lied about his income and I once again can barely provide for my children. The boys also have his family, his gf and all of her family. They spend a lot on my kids and I'm always left ashamed and apologetic. When my older son was 6 weeks old, in March of 2001, his 2nd affair was revealed. I attempted to overdose on Darvoset. I wound up with liver damage and was hospitalized but survived. Previously He and I had lost two children, a daughter stillborn in 1999 and a miscarriage 10 months later. I was sexually abused as a child by a step father, beaten by my first boyfriend, raped at 18 and terminated 2 pregnancies. I fought so hard to overcome the life I lived. I met my current husband in July 2012. He swept me off my feet, my heart had healed and I allowed myself to love Him completely. We were married by May 2013. By November 21, 2013 everything started to fall apart.He turned out to be a Narcissistic, Bipolar, liar, drug addict, alcoholic, emotionally and mentally abusive, sending naked pictures to other work men, porn, gambling, adultery, arrests. He broke me. I thought I knew pain, I was wrong. Last year when he decided out of the blue to move out of state, I took several handfuls of Trazodone and Oxycotin. I woke up the next day, he had moved out. He left me there to die. He read my letter and just left. I was bakeracted the next day. That serves no purpose. It just add humiliation and embarrassment. After the past 18 months of his begging for another chance, his false attempts at getting himself help it's once again been revealed he's lied and cheated. This time with a 24 yr old who may be carrying his child. I was once a star in my career, I once believed I had at least something Inwas a success at. That too is no more. Now I'm almost 50, alone, broken, with a body eaten up by osteoarthritis. My children don't need me, I'm nothing but a burden. My job doesn't need me, they see me as part of an old way of doing things. The younger crowd gets the promotions. My opinion and 31 years experience don't matter. I have no pets, no partner and only“friends” who want me to be who I once was. They say they care, but when I risk reaching out I'm received with comments like “pull up your big girl painted” , “stop being so negative”, “other people have it worse”. The once social butterfly, the beautiful girl with the beautiful heart has left the building. I'm not that person any more and faking it everyday leaves me more and more exhausted and determined to stop the pain. I don't know who I am anymore other than nothing. A problem. I used to love who I was, now I despise myself. I have no purpose. I am useless to all who know me. I have little to no Family or friends. I'm tired and so, so lonely. I want it all to stop.",

The allowance I set aside for myself to tide over until march is spent because I had to pay the bills. Again. I've got nothing but deadlines once 2018 comes and one of them involves surveying people.

They put me on an EKG, which turned out fine too. And that was when my doctor asked me the question: &gt; Have you ever experienced Anxiety before? All I could say to that question was 'No'. I never knew much of Anxiety, and in my grand ignorance I thought it was something I never particularly experienced. I never had issues with it before...

Yet here I was, simply trying to sleep and my heart was racing to a point where I thought I might need to go to the emergency room. The more I described the sensation I was feeling, the more \"Anxiety attack\" was brought up.

Shortly after I start dating this other girl, my ability to last started to tank, and it wasn't because I was trying to get off quickly. I want nothing more (truly) than to satisfy my partner first, so this probably started messing with my head for a bit. This didn't seem to strain our relationship, though I imagine it did and I just didn't realize it. Anyway, this girl is manipulative and toxic. She would gaslight constantly, and many times the topics were regarding her ex-boyfriend. She would 'break up' with me over really petty stuff and then get back together with me; toying with my emotions. I was weak and let it continue for far far far far too long. In fact, we broke up right before she and I headed to the same college. However, upon getting there, she treats me like her boyfriend, but kinda keeps her distance. I decide to end it there, and of course I was demonized for it. Next semester, I fuck up. I see her with some other guy (who happens to now be my roommate and good friend, coincidentally) at a party and I start freaking out a little. Long story short, she starts leading me on while she's seeing this other guy and truly does fuck with my emotions. It's bad. Really bad. I'm too weak to walk away and she knows it, so she keeps me as her 'side guy' that she just uses for her own benefit whenever she feels like. I'm severely depressed. One night she tells me that the dude and her are now dating, and I'm crushed. I freak out again, lots of drama. We can't talk to each other anymore, but she continues to gossip about me to her friends around campus. I become persona non grata on campus. I leave, come back a year later, and things have cooled off. That was 5-6 years ago. I have dated 2 women in that period. One immediately after I left, and another one much more recently. In both cases, I couldn't last in bed at all. Well, the more recent (and more serious) relationship, there were a couple of occasions where I could and it was pretty great, but I have NO IDEA why I was able to last and can't seem to replicate it. To the point: After that fiasco in college, I was essentially celibate (not by choice) for 3-4 years, and then 2 years after a period of time where I dated someone. I have no confidence in myself (even though people tell me they wonder why because apparently I'm attractive and have things going for me - I don't see it), so this means that I rarely 'pursue' women (I'm sorry that sounds a little disrespectful; I can't think of a better term right now. My objective isn't to sleep with a bunch of women. I'd rather have a close, intimate relationship with someone I really care for). I did actually go on a Tinder date a couple of months ago. We did wind up having sex, but of course, I didn't last. We went out a second time: same result. What's even more frustrating about this is anyone I've asked says 'Oh, when you're going to cum, just stop and play with her for a bit' or 'do kegels'. A) Kegels don't seem to do jack for me. It's made literally 0 difference in that regard. B ) I can't 'stop when I'm about to cum' because I literally cum immediately upon insertion. It's not even pleasurable for me. I just cum. And no, I can't keep going. All of this has made me afraid of sex. I'm just so fucking embarrassed. I'm a 26 y/o that's worse at performing sexually than a virgin. I do see a counselor (not a sex counselor - one for my depression), but nothing seems to help with my confidence and I think that this could be one root cause, but I'",

I don't have it diagnosed, nor do I know if what I'm feeling isn't even in the same ball park as someone with diagnosed social anxiety, so I apologize if I'm completely off in this. I've always been awkward, though only around certain people. With family or close friends, I've been mostly alright. I still contantly find myself thinking \"That was so stupid. Why would you say/do *that*?\" hours of days after it happens. The place that really got me was on sports teams. I grew up playing ice hockey. I played for one club from when I started to when I was 14 and played for their oldest team. I knew mostly the same kids throughout those years. The last year there is where I really started to see a difference. This is around the time where most kids start to become the \"hypebeast\" types. Always giving shit to others and being general assholes. I wasn't really like that. I was told by others that, and have noticed myself, that I'm more calm and generally nicer. I was never really \"cool\". On that team is where I really started to experience shit with them. I had by bag thrown out of the locker room when I went to the lobby, then being locked out and forced to dress outside the locker room on a bench. I was always met with a groan from whoever I was playing with on my line for that game. Everything I did seemed to be analyzed to see how I could've been made fun of for it. I now am a freshman in high school, and play for my school. Mostly new kids, aside from two I had known from the previously mentioned team. I'm with mostly juniors and sophomores. I lack the coolness of the other couple freshman on my team, and I lack the seniority and respect that comes with being a junior. On this team, again, most of the things said to me are people making fun of things I do or just giving me shit. I know I shouldn't take it that seriously, but I can't stop myself from doing so. Everything I do seems to be scrutinized here as well. All eyes seem to be on me. Usually, I'll just shut my mouth and not talk, though something is usually found to give me shit then too. I'm not a bad player: I've proven myself to be a good player and hold my own. I'm afraid to being this kind of stuff up to the captains of the team, since at this level captains are pretty much just the most popular. i fear that I'll be called a pussy or whatever name they think up. Not saying all are bad. A genuine compliment from one of these guys, thought they don't come from the guys who make fun, are like nothing else when I hear them. I was given one the other day, and still think about it and feel good about it. Sorry if this feels like a \"woe is me\" post.",

I ended up seeking treatment at the mental health center on campus and I started attending regular appointments about a month after my first intake. Because I couldn't leave my dorm for extended periods of time, my academic advisor said my best option was to petition for a retroactive withdrawal (the official drop date had passed when I went to go see my advisor). My parents have no idea I've been getting treatment for my anxiety nor do they know I've decided to withdraw from classes due to failing grades. Both of my parents have very short tempers and getting mad/yelling is their go-to reaction to every issue, big or small. Not only that but whenever the topic of mental health comes up, my dad usually calls every condition \"an excuse\" and he calls the people suffering from them \"crazy\".

We took trips together. We had a nice house. I had a good paying job that I liked. Then in 2015 we got divorced. I had no clue how much things would go downhill after the divorce but basically I do not enjoy life anymore at all. I wake up everyday and just want the day to be over. I can't stand to go through everything everyday. All the bullshit. All the annoyances. I have no friends to talk to. Maybe one but I don't talk to him that often. I have siblings I get along with but they are busy with their own families and don't live nearby. I got laid off from the job I liked and have to take low paying jobs just to survive. Due to the lack of money, I was forced to move in with my parents. All they do all day is sit around, talk, and watch tv. That's what retirement is about. How shitty. It's such a fucking depressing and unmotivating environment. It kills me. There is always noise. It's always loud. There is no such thing as peace and quiet. There is no such thing as privacy. A person in their mid to late 30s should not have to live with their parents. It's a very small and cramped house to make matters worse. I feel trapped here. I feel like there is no hope for me. I am so lost. I don't even know where to turn to or who to go to because all my friends have drifted away. I think about suicide every single day because I'm so hopeless. I can't see anything improving. Since getting divorced things have just continued to get worse for me. I don't know what to do. I have never ever been so unhappy. Everytime I try to improve I get nowhere. I have been applying to jobs that are more suited to me and will allow me to get my own place but I have not even gotten an interview. It's pointless to even try. I'm just wasting time. I even tried to find people to date through the stupid online dating world and that was another waste of time. I give up.",

My name is lucky i have a big issue that i want to address and that is depression with teens and young adults. There is a reason why i made this post. and that reason is that it is a serious issue and one that isn't addressed very often. In recent times there came some attention thanks to logic and his song but that blew off rather quick. let me just start with a note just saying i don't do this for any attention or anything like that i don't want sympathy i just want to make people will think different about depression. I'll tell you my story later Mostly of the time depression is something that is seen as weak and something you cant talk about or is something you shouldn't talk about. And that is something that is strong with teens is that its weird to talk about it or search for help. But let me tell you right now that it something you have to do to get over it and fight the depression. It's not weak or anything like that it doesn't matter who you are a male or female or what your believes are in no way is it bad to search for help and talk about it.and i highly advise you to do that find help talk to people that can help you. my story It all began April 10th when i started an internship for my education and that went great and all. But first some background info. I never really was skinny in any form i was always the fat kid. I weight about 120 kg and that never bothered me in and kind of way. It wasn't that. i had some good friends at school i met them 3 years ago and we really became a good group of friends we went to the same classes and we were all in the same age group. But let me get back to the story so it was in April that i started my internship and that i didn't go to school anymore so there where 2 friends i didn't saw anymore but we chatted and skyped each other so that was all cool and 1 friend of mine that left school that year worked where i was doing my internship so i saw my friends quite often. And from that start that worked out all fine. So 4 weeks into my internship its the 1st of may and we had another intern coming in and the first moment i met the other intern i fell in love with her and so that weeks advances and on the 5th of may her bus didn't come for an hour so i offered here a ride and she took it we talked a little bit and we exchanged numbers the same day. And everything went well i had lots of contact with her with my friend and thanks to her i started to exercise asked her out on a date and she said yes so that was a huge motivation. Skip 2 weeks and there is where it turned bad i acted like an ass in front of her not my self and whe had some fights nothing mayor but in between fights i felt really depressed but i still had my friend who was there for me and looked after me. 2 weeks later and i didnt get any better more fights she now blocked me from every mode of talking to her from whatsapp to text and it took me hard that day i was certain i didnt want to live anymore i dont want to be here and i feel bad because it is my fault. I had my friends with me who stopped me that day they talked me out of it when they noticed i wanted to shoot my self or drive into a wall and i thank them for that. So i didn't get any better over time 4 weeks later my friend from work was gone and i had some bad blood with the girl but nothing that mayor then usual but i still liked her and that never changed. So we began talking more in real life and it became a little better but then it became June 15th and that's when her and my internship stopped i decided i wanted to work there for the summer but before she left i still wanted to know what did i do wrong to her and is there a way to fix it. i went to ask her and she didn't say anything to me nothing at al i had never felt worse then that day. So summer went on and that was not fun i was there alone all my friends where on vacation one joined the army and the other one the police so we didn't talk anymore and the other one we kinda talked but only once a week for 10 minutes.

Rough childhood. Stopped when I was 11 really when I was too scared to go to school and maybe get beaten up again. Secondary school wasn't better at all. Could talk about that shitty place all day. I'll just leave it at anytime I pass by I imagine it erupting in flames with some choice people inside. Should mention one of the hardest things in secondary school was in my last year when 2 good friends of mine killed themselves. One I still don't know why and it haunts me even now almost 3 years later. The other I know why between him battling depression and having attempted it before losing his closest friend. I just wish I saw what was happening sooner. I could've maybe done something and that guilt is still there now. Recently my 2 closest friends in college turned on me out of nowhere with no good reason and kicked me out of all the group work we were doing together for another guy they were friends with. I had to leave and drive home straight away or it would've gotten ugly when he told me. That was over a month ago now. Still havent had contact with them and I don't plan to change that anytime soon. Still hurts though even if they arent friends anymore. Still fucking hurts. My depression came back stronger than ever around the time of this. Didnt help that the girl I love more than anything broke up with me. She broke my heart. We had plans for our whole lives together and had been making long distance work. I know she's the one and she said she was sure I was but that she fell out of love with me romantically with her in NY and me back in Dublin again. We had the whole summer together and it was perfect. Best days of my life. She loved it too. We were both in tears at the airport when I kissed her goodbye I just didn't think it'd be for good. she's moving on already but says she still imagines a future with me. Just that she didn't feel that kind of romantic love rn. Idk I think at this point she was saying something I needed to hear cause she's afraid of what I'll do. Everyone around me is. I wish I hid my emotions like in the past. I hate seeing them worried all the time. I tried to kill myself one night just after all this. Only thing that stopped me was the other lives it would ruin. Its still the only thing stopping me. I'm taking up self harming again. Maybe I'll be lucky and wont scar this time either if I get through all this but if I don't feel any better January 5th will be my last day. Im so tired of it all. I'm tired of trying. I have fuck all friends. The girl I love broke my heart. College is harder than ever. I know I can get a good job and be up there in the 1% but I don't fucking care anymore. Id give it all up to feel okay again. But if I don't then on January 5th I will end all this pain once and for all. I wish I had never existed so I couldn't hurt anyone else doing this.

Anyways, I've been like this for many years. My first suicide experience was when I lost my cousin. He hung himself when I was 12 and ever since then I've been kind of.... fascinated? Fascinated at the fact that it's an option... so I starting weaning into it. I'd cut myself. I'd see how it feels to have a rope around my neck very tight. I've made many attempts while in my teenage years from hanging myself to cutting and to take pills for an overdose. When I got to the hospital that morning (this happened about 2am) I had already taken this black stuff that cancels out or something to the pills I felt bubbling and eating my stomache. Then the child services got involved because I was only 16 at the time. They forced me to see a therapist, and I did. I didn't stop cutting myself though but I had channelled it into poetry. After a while I guess it helped? But I had aged out into seeing that therapist. Seen him for 2 years. I didn't bother trying to see another one because I didn't wanna start over again. I had suffered being bullied by people saying I was faking it or was doing it just for some attention. But I was still fascinated by it... ever since then I'd always imagine these scenarios where I killed myself... who'd be there... How would it affect certain people like my friends. Or the people that bullied me. Every time I attempted there was always a note. Fast forward 11 years and many attempts later. Today. I am 29 years old and I still get suicidal thoughts... one time I was so deep in thought I hadn't realized I picked up a rope. It never stopped. Still today I think of loading my gun and offing myself with a bullet to the brain. Couple weeks ago I had a flashback because I had a suicidal episode because of some problems me and the mrs was having, her friend intervened and said some stuff that reminded me of all the things that was said to me while growing up... I was told to man up... and then all these memories poured into my head. So these thoughts have been much more frequent since then... everyday it seems like. I don't wanna die, but I do... I have a nice life. A good job. Great kids... But I still wanna die... what's wrong with Me? I'm scared one day I'm actually gonna do it.",

But I feel like I can't go for more than a few days without becoming abundantly aware of how terribly I miss how much I loved him.

I've not once felt anything remotely close to that with my current boyfriend, which only makes me feel worse because I don't love him like I want to. I'm not in a position to leave him though, because we're in a lease together and can't really pay rent without the other. Besides that though, I just don't know how I can get back anything close to that amazing feeling of truly loving someone unconditionally.

I feel like I'm dealing with all this crap for nothing, I can't picture myself getting out of the hole I'm in, so why bother. I feel like doesn't matter how hard I try, I'll still see myself as a dumb person that have a baby dick and a personality of a door knob. I have been 8 years without any sort of intimacy in any level with a girl. Every girl that I start to remotely get interested I talk myself out, I feel like dragging someone in any type of relationship with me would be unfair to that person, I see all those guys that although they too are dealing with the burden of life they look and act like they are on top of it, so why and how I would be able to keep up with that. I hardly get out of my house because I know I'm not a good company, so instead of ruining it for everyone I keep my shit for myself, but that is catching up with my mother because she is really chatty, a couple hours ago my sister talked about that to me but in a way as if I don't like them and getting out of where I live would be the solution for all my problems. (I talk a lot about moving to another country). But what fucked me up isn't what she said, but how they are perceiving me, if there is anything that is keeping me from killing myself it is them, so listening her talk about that was brutal to me, I tried to talk to her but from every two words I tried to say I started to cry in-between. The best part of my day is when I get on my shitty motorcycle and put my helmet with reflective visor, since no one is seeing what is behind that helmet it gives me the feeling of not being myself, if that makes sense.

Some background: I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 4, but my mom decided that I was too young for that to be true, and instead sent me to various religious institutions and revivals so I could be \"healed.\" The reason she took me to a therapist in the first place was due to the fact that I would bite my nails so often, and so low, that my fingers would bleed, along with some other strange behaviors. I am now 26, and I have become suspicious that I have been living my entire life by just thinking that the way I feel all of the time is normal, and the way everyone else feels.

I think I have, but I don't think it's ever been severe as others have had it. I do however have panic disorder and depersonalization, that shit really sucks. I've gotten professional help. I've gotten better. I just wanted to talk. I don't think I'm suicidal but I am very open to not living anymore. I am horrified of death, sudden and inexplicable death is an overwhelming fear for me and it's a huge contributor to my anxiety. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac. I have started to think that perhaps it would be better to actually die than always worrying about dying. There is just something about the idea of never existing again and the endless black abyss, it scares the shit out of me but if I went through with it I wouldn't have to be scared. It'd be like before I was I born. I have had 9 relationships. All of them have failed and it's always been my fault. I've been cheated on and abused but it always comes back to me. I'm not emotional enough. I am a husk of a person. I have never experienced love again and I've never been truly happy again. I cannot return the affection of people I date and I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been surrounded by death my entire life. As I grew up, every single person on my moms side of the family died. A few on my dads side too. Lost more family than anyone should. My best friend committed suicide in 7th grade, shot himself in the head. I haven't gone a single day without thinking about it. I am now a freshman in college. I don't really know the point of this and I feel like it'll just upset other people, I guess I just want to express how I'm feeling onto an open forum. I feel like I have zero purpose in life. Nothing makes me happy. I cannot experience happiness anymore. My only moments of happiness are when I'm with my friends and making other people happy. I exist for other people, but when I am alone I have no reason to exist. I have no goals in life. I have no interests besides music and art and those will never take me anywhere because I'm not good at enough at either. I'm not even studying music or art, I'm completely undecided in my major and I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. What is the point of being conscious if we will eventually die? Why are we made aware of emotion and experiences? It's horrible. I am so scared. I don't think I could kill myself because of my friends and family. I know what the suicide of loved ones does to people. I want them to live their happy lives and I never would want to upset them. All I am around for is them, all I want is to make everybody happy. However, existence really is dreadful for me. I am horrified of living because I might die, what kind of backwards logic is that? If depersonalization ever returns, I easily see myself ending my life. I can't do it again. I seem like such a crazy person. I can't drink and I'm in college, I can't smoke, some days I can't even leave my dorm. There is so much that will cause a panic attack for me. I just want to go away. I want to die but have everyone think I am alive so that they wouldn't be upset. I don't know what to do anymore. I cannot find a single reason for my existence. I am not a person. I am a collection of all my friends and the things that make them happy. When it comes to myself, there is nothing that makes me worthy of life.",

Meaning I work, study, have a girlfriend, a large social group etc. All my trauma and depression stem from my childhood and teenage years, which were a never ending nightmare. In the adult world, I've always managed to do really well. There are only 2 of my male friends who know I have suicidal tendencies, both of whom I told while on a drunken whim. I have good and bad days, but these last 2 months have continually been pretty horrible, mainly because of a career fuck-up which might be irreversible and fuck me hard financially and socially in the long term. For the first time since learning about my disease, I find myself in a steady relationship. After living for 6 months in the same city as her, I'm now taking a job in another country, but still within fly distance. We've decided to give long distance a shot, and then once she's done with college in a year we'll attempt to relocate to the same city again. She has absolutely no clue I'm depressed. To her I'm always cheerful, happy, and a pillar of support. I'm also, in all probability, not going to kill myself within the next few years. I've been taking active steps following my doctor's advice on how to deal with depression, and these have for the most time worked quite well, although I'm sure I will never rid myself of it completely. So I guess, my question is more along the lines of: Is it unethical not to tell her? While the chance of me committing suicide is slim, she is ready to committ herself to me, and potentially move in, have children, get married etc. Does all that warrant knowing about my mental health? I'm honestly afraid she would leave me. I come across as Mr. Perfect to a lot of people, and she definitely does as well, going to med school, doing instagram fitness and all that shit. While I've never known her to be shallow, I have no idea how she would react. I wouldn't blame her if having a bf who gets mental breakdowns and is considering quitting life for good is not appealing. And I certainly don't believe it's a quality women initially look after in a man, as it hardly warrants stability or safety.

I've been feeling this lately, and it's a hard feeling because it makes me feel selfish and entitled, but I try to tell myself that it's okay to feel this way. My family and my husband are amazing! My husband is probably the best person I know. He listens to me and is so kind. This Christmas, he's gotten me so many awesome gifts that I'd forgotten I'd even wanted! He blows me away constantly with his affection and attention and he's genuinely the best man and most wonderful partner. There's one thing I want though, that I know I may never ask for. Maybe not anytime soon. Something to know is that we are a blended family. He's been in my life for 3 years and recently became step-dad to my 6yo daughter who he adores. My daughter has a huge loving family including my awesome ex husband (her dad) and we have tons of support, so while I don't even have my daughter 100% of the time, when I do have her, my attention is focused almost entirely on her. One thing I do as a spouse and parent to make my family feel loved is to simply take care of them. I want them to have a tidy, organized space where they can be happy, grow, work, learn, and feel relaxed. I enjoy cleaning the house and cooking meals and doing chores no one asks me to do, like laundry, straight down to putting it away. No one likes to do that stuff, but I do it BECAUSE no one likes to do it and I know it feels good when you get home and it's already done. My husband loves my daughter and will take her out sometimes so I can relax alone, but he still isn't used to being woken up early by a child and can get kind of grumbly, so I wake up sometimes after having only 5ish hours of sleep just so that I can be awake when she wakes up so as to avoid having her crawl into our bed and wake him up and get on his early-morning nerves. Like I said earlier, he is so loving. He really does pay attention and often does things that make it clear to me that he cares about how I feel and that he wants to surprise me and make me feel appreciated. But more than anything—any gift, any special note, any hug or kiss—here is what I want: I want a day where I can be with my precious love—my little girl—and totally enjoy her without having stress about her needs. I want him to wake up with her, make her breakfast, lunch, etc. And I want a day where he cleans the whole house and makes dinner and I don't have to lift a finger. The thing is: while he values tidiness and cleanliness to a degree, he cleans when he thinks something needs to be cleaned, ergo, I don't think he interprets 90% of the work I do in that regard as an act of love, so much as he just sees it as me taking care of things I deem responsibilities. If anything, he wouldn't care or notice if I skipped a Saturday of cleaning. He wouldn't care if I quit trying new recipes to make dinners from. If I stopped showing him love in HIS language—notes, physical affection, verbal affection—he would notice. He would hate that. But I don't think he fully understands that the physical effort and energy I put into caring for him and my daughter every day is how I show love. I don't have to clean as much as I do, or work at being so organized, or cook meals. They don't expect or need those things, mostly because they're amazing people who are both (daughter included) fairly low-maintenance and don't view me as a female workhorse. In fact, my husband often invites me to slow down and relax. When he does invite me to slow down and relax, though, I often wish he would take over.

        "query": "Will moving away from my parents make me happier? I'm a 24, male, still living with my Mom and my Step Dad. Little bit about me. I've never written all of this out before, so forgive me, it's gonna be a long one. I currently live near the Chicago area after moving here from South Dakota back in 2015. I grew up there and the majority of my friends live there still. I've always been short on self-confidence, had terrible anxiety, some season depression, and severe ADHD. I decided to move here back in 2015 after my Mom divorced my previous step-dad (no complaints there, he was an ashole) moved here in 2014. After she left, I lived with him for a year because I wanted to decide if moving to Illinois would really be a good idea, rather than just heading out with her before I was sure. Because of the drastic difference in living cost, I've been continuing to live with my parents until I found a suitable roommate. Currently, I work as an engineering/IT recruiter for an agency in one of the suburbs, making $44k. I'm good at what I do, however I hate it. I myself am skilled in web development and marketing, yet despite how many jobs I apply for in those fields, nobody calls me back. What I really love to do is writing. I've always loved screenwriting, in particular. Back in South Dakota, I used to write daily. I was constantly filled with inspiration, motivation, and enthusiasm, and had high hopes of eventually getting my scripts in front of people who mattered in the industry. Even if I didn't, at the very least all I want is to just write and work a full-time job I enjoy. However, since moving here I've written very, very little. As a matter of fact, I haven't had the motivation to write ANYTHING in the last seven months. And I link that to all of the struggles that I describe in this post. But I'll end this part by just saying this. I miss writing. I miss it so fucking much, and I just want to have that motivation back. Little bit about my parents. When I moved out here in the summer of 2015, my Step-Dad, a great guy, was making $200k a year. In November of 2015 however his job fucked him over, he was laid off, and now he's making $60k a year. My Mom is making $44k. My Mom, I firmly believe, is the main source of all of my problems with depression right now. Take every mental issue I mentioned above and multiply it by tenfold. She had a rough life to begin with, but around that time when my Dad got laid off, her best friends at work started to turn on her and have been harassing and bullying her DAILY for the last 2 1/2 years. One of the former friends is her boss. So almost every day since, she's come home just a wreck. She bursts down sobbing every few days because she's worried that she's a failure, she's upset about the people she works with, and most of all she and my Dad are miserable because of the financial issues. This is the household I come home to. Some weeks are better than others, but for the most part I just stay in my room and avoid them while I listen to them argue or her crying. Before you ask \"why doesn't she quit?\", believe me, I ask this constantly. She's afraid that if she leaves then she won't find anything else and that the financial burden will be even worse. My Dad has been amazing though. He does everything he can to provide and works his ass off to keep her from just shutting down. He's the first man she's been with that I approve of. I'm glad he's there for her. The highlight of my life right now, and the only reason I haven't packed my stuff back up and moved back to South Dakota, is my girlfriend. I have a pretty rocky history when it comes to relationships. I won't go into too much detail there, but I'll say that last year was the worst for me. My previous girlfriend and I went through an abortion. It was a simple mistake, one that I",

So when I first started at my job, my employer said that we would revisit my contract every 3 months and give me a raise if I've succeeded in my role. It's been 7 months since then...in that time, we've moved towards a new service and he's been telling me that he needs time since he has to pay for new software/hire other people so I haven't brought it up. Just had a long talk recently with him about my position and he basically said until I accomplish goals including doing some tasks perfectly without his help (like making an analysis report for instance or deal with clients) he can't give me a raise. Basically he wants me to be an expert but is forgetting the fact that I just recently graduated college. I feel like I'm being set up to fail since I'm still learning--plus I've had to learn some tools/software that weren't even in the original contract and I've had to make him acknowledge that I've achieved tremendous progress. BTW- wasn't paid for learning those tools. He has a habit of overpraising others and when it comes down to it, ripping them down. For example when I was working with other devs (again, not in my contract) he said I was doing a good job at \"project management\". When I included that in the reasons for why I should get a raise, he said it wasn't really \"project management\" but \"working with the team\". When I also started, he told us that he would give us benefits in September. Since this is my first job (at a startup), I don't really know what's normal/what's not but I feel like employees shouldn't have to fight to even have a discussion about progress and a raise. I feel like he wouldn't mind if I forgot about it and just kept slaving away...he doesn't like talking about money but does like talking about his expectations of me. I'm the one that has to remind him and sit him down to discuss my progress and when I do, he always has \"excuses\" about how I'm not up to the level of a \"real\" professional...aka someone with a few years under their belt. Of course I'm not! I've outperformed everyone he's hired before to learn these tools but I'm not at an expert level yet where I can do it at a very high level! I guess it all came to a head today when I told him clearly that I was expecting the raise....btw the raise is $2 more (my rate was $12 but supposed to be increased by $2 after every 3 months). I can't believe I'm fighting for an extra $2. He told me that \"We discussed a raise, it doesn't mean we can retroactively make the previous hours worked that raise. I'm happy to discuss with you those qualifications we talked about and work out when we can officially start the raise.\" The fuck? I should've gotten a raise in July and again in October! I guess I should also mention that we just lost a few clients so he really doesn't HAVE the $$$ to pay me...and he doesn't think what I do is valuable enough to pay me that much which is why he's squirreling around the point.

Anyway, during this year I've been showing an increasing lack of motivation and happiness. It started around the April I think. I've always been really motivated and generally happy person with a lot of projects and hobbies (music, programming, videogames, 3D modelling, etc) that I really loved. But this year has been... different. Starting a lot of projects left unfinished, feeling tired and empty a lot of the time, dropped out of the sport I was practicing because I just couldn't go out there and put energy into something, although always suffering from introversion, it was totally worse than before. I never considered suicide a solution to anything though, I strongly believe that I could never do that or even harm myself for dealing with this. Finishing the secondary school two weeks ago didn't help because I already lost almost all connection to my school friends (almost all my friends are school friends, except a few). And a week from now it's my graduation night (kinda like prom but not quite) and I'm already feeling really anxious and the feeling of not wanting to go is growing stronger and stronger, but I'm going anyway because I already payed lots for the invitations and clothes. Also, distance is growing between me and my crush, to which I was really close before, and it just makes me sad. Nowadays, my routine is basically wake up at 1 PM, eating, playing videogames, do some chores, if I'm feeling inspired I might play piano for a while but not too much, and go to sleep.

We would all be better off if the world just exploded or went into the sun. We would all be free of our pain and suffering forever. Yes, there would also be no happiness or joy, but this doesn't matter as we wouldn't be aware of it. You can't miss or desire anything if you don't exist. These are the thoughts going through my head at the moment. I cannot seem to escape the claws of my dreadful existence. It was like I was born to be unhappy, and at the moment I don't see any option other than suicide. I have been to therapy, but the support it gave me was always temporary and did not help to solve the fundamental issues in my life. Many of these issues cannot be permanently fixed, so I will have to deal with them for the rest of my days. But I can't. I'm tired of feeling miserable all the time. I just want it to end. If you have any thoughts, philosophical or otherwise, I would love to hear them. In the meantime I will be numbing my brain with booze and weed until I find a reason to live again.",

I have hurt myself several times but I eventually got tired of it (burned my left hand, cut my forearm like 4 times, I would scratch my hands until I bled out of anxiety). Dropped out of school because it was sucking the life out ot me and (ironically, I was in a public school) it started to leave my mom penniless. I used to love school so much, but I started to hate it and I woukd wonder everytime I heard the alarm (which would sound at 4.30 am, so I could get to school at 6.30) if waking up was really worth it. I'm really, really sick. I'm afraid I may have some psychopath tendencies. Had suicidal thoughts for a while. I can't stand most people, not interested in socializing. Narcissistic as fuck. I want to have psychiatric treatment but neither mom or I can afford it. I love spending time with my mom but she never listens to me, isn't interested in my well being, blames my condition on me, tells me that I do nothing when I do all of the housework (we have a big-ass house) and I help her with all of her work stuff and also every time she gets sick. I even looked for a job to help her with money but nobody wanted to hire me. For a while I lost interest in everything I love and enjoy, even in life, also became numb. I hated that. I'm not there anymore but I'm still depressed. Everyday I wish this was the last. I want to be on antidepressants but my mom doesn't like actual medicine and all I think about that is that I would probably plan on overdose. Thinking of ways I could hang myself.

Movies are my passion and going to the cinema makes me not feel empty. And the series I watch, and my kitties, reading new books and comic books, reading new stuff in general, trying a new recipe, a new outfit, listening to my favorite music and singing along to that, looking at cool pictures on the internet, drawing my favorite characters (art-block is a bitch.

Hello all, I am a 34 year old male. 14 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and given ritalin. It immediately gave me a panic attack and I thought I was having a heart attack. This happened on maybe too other occaisons when I ate too many weed brownies. Other than that I really can't remember any times where I've truly felt anxious. Last week I just felt off, a tension in my chest, fluttery feeling, heart palpitations, hot/cold sweats, numb/cold/heavy arms, constant belching, shaky hands and my heart-rate monitor continued to bouce from 65-95 in a matter of seconds. Of course, I'm sure staring at it had something to do with this. I've also been having terrible nightmares. Nothing in my life has changed to cause this. No extra stresses or anything. I stopped smoking weed, drinking booze and coffee since saturday and my symptoms have only gotten worse. I went to my doctor who checked my thyroid, blood, urine and everything came back clean outside of a little high cholesterol and blood pressure. He considered my heart-rate a “normal arythmia” for someone my age and I shouldnt worry about it. He put me on a 24hr holter monitor which I dropped off earlier today. A few hours later, I am at work feeling okay. All of a sudden my left arm felt heavy and it really freaked me out. Gave me a full-on panic attack. I called the doctors and they said that normally if there is any cause for concern from the results of the holter monitor they would have heard right away, so I shouldnt worry too much. I had another bad panic attack when I got home today. I am now just in constant fear of having a heart attack and keeling over. Why would this happen when I don't really have a history of anxiety, and nothing seemed to trigger this? Thanks so much for taking the time to read this.

On July 19th last year I received a phonecall while I was at work to inform me that my Dad had been found dead in his bedroom after taking his own life. I did not anticipate this, there were no signs any of us could perceive that would have made us think that this was on the cards. When I found out I just didn't know what to do, I was 30 minutes away by car, and I don't drive, I had to wait for someone to come and get me. In the time shortly after I found out I lost all touch with reality and just screamed the most primal sound I've ever produced. I didn't believe it was really happening to me. I told my Mother, then my partner who works nearby turned up and I told her too. They took it better than me, but not much. We travelled together to the house, and the funeral director (a family friend) answers the door and simply said \"He was my friend, I'm so sorry\". I learned they'd tried to move his body before I arrived. I'm glad they didn't because I'd never have forgiven them for it. Of course, following this I went to see him; my partner and mother insisted on accompanying me. The police were there too. He looked peaceful, just asleep on the bed, there was some rigor mortis meaning I couldn't fully see his face because his arm was covering it, but otherwise he was just asleep. I put my hand on his head and when I felt that terrible chill it was all of a sudden too real for me. I broke down and kicked everybody else out of the room and just spent some time alone with the empty shell of what was once my loving, vibrant, humourous father. After they came to take him away - and I'll always ask myself why I did this - I lay on the bed where he was and just cried. I learned later on that he'd attempted this once before, but they kept this information from me as I was 16 at the time (29 now) and I wouldn't have handled the information well at the time. I was the quintessential emo kid. You can imagine. I was given the notes he left, and what he left me was a paltry 1/3rd of an A4 with some very simple platitudes about why he'd done it. Some imagined infidelity in his relationship, not being able to go on without this woman. I feel selfish for saying it but I was disappointed. I expected more as his son. I wanted answers I could never get. I looked through his messages and his social media accounts and found absolutely nothing. I'd been trying to arrange to see him quite a lot in the weeks building up but he kept having to re-arrange. I wish I'd seen him one more time. Since then, there's been a funeral, an inquest, and I've dealt with all his possessions and affairs. I haven't really been able to deal with the emotional aftermath even 6 months later, however. I've been attending counselling and trying to lay my thoughts out and get my head around the whole thing, but there's an intangible force at work inside me that's just bleeding out into my everyday life and making everything many times more difficult. My relationship (I'm due to be married in April), my health (smoking, drinking, overweight), my personality (I was happy and funny, now I'm angry or depressed), and my outlook for the future (I somehow feel I'll end up alone) have all changed for the worse. I've had days where I feel suicidal myself, even though it's completely illogical based on what it did to me. I've been feeling like sabotaging my entire life. Abandoning my home, my relationship, my family, my job. Everything. Just leaving the country and never returning. Ultimately I don't know what to do anymore. I feel lost and alone, and nothing is helping. Thanks for reading. Tl;dr - My Dad killed himself and it's ruining my life.",

That you're destined to become what you think you'll be in the future. You set your own destiny, your fate is determined by what you believe you are capable of, stuff like that. But my future-vision has never lied to me. When I was 12 I became very. very depressed. Chains held me to my bed and tore my flesh when I tried to leave. I faked headaches to avoid school and instead laid in bed all day and when my mom left for work, opened my computer and tried to take my mind off of the encompassing grief that felt like it would never leave. It continued for years. Except, I knew. After the first few episodes of never-ending thoughts barreling through my mind, many sleepless nights, a surge in libido and confidence...I knew. My future-vision told me that when I was 18, I was going to be diagnosed and my parents would finally see. I knew it, deep down in my bones, the static buzzing so loud I was surprised nobody else could hear it. I was no Sylvia Plath; there was no I am, I am, I am. Instead, I heard the chant of, bipolar, bipolar, bipolar. I'm 18, in the psych ward for a week because I walked into my counselor's office and said, \"If you let me leave I will kill myself.\" It had been too long dealing with the ups and downs, exacerbated be the Lexapro my doctor had put me on. I was an asshole to my family and to myself. I felt like there was no moving forward. I still don't think there is, but that's another drunken ramble for another time. To put it simply, the psych ward helped in a few ways. It's comforting to know you're not the only fucked up person in there.I like meeting other fucked up people. Where am I today? My future-vision knew there would be stagnation. My life has been roaring floods and then desert-dry droughts. This is a drought. I hope it ends soon, but I know it won't. Stillness is almost worse than bouncing around. A Sherlock Holmes quote comes to mind, but I'm too drunk to remember it. My future-vision likes to tell me that by the time I'm 30 I'll be broke, living in a shitty apartment, an alcoholic with no friends and no way out. That I'll die by 35. That my life will be fast, hard, and cold. i don't like it, but my future vision does not lie. I pray to gods I don't believe in every night that it isn't true, that I'll be wrong just this once. I look at my painting, no direction, sloppy brushwork as my hands can't handle preciseness well now. IT's a man in red holding a flower. His grin will turn sinister when I can paint over the oil I have once it dries. I don't know what it means yet, but it creeps me out that instead of the landscapes I was taught, my paintings are dark, not something to be displayed in a family room. I'd like to be famous, as I feel my story is worth sharing. Everybody should be famous in their own way. Our stories are all beautiful and should be known. I feel this when I'm stone-cold sober. I don't know when to end. I've been manic for weeks. I did not know this until my mom mentioned it a few days ago. I'm no longer in touch with myself, the insightfulness mentioned by doctors as faded. Maybe I never really knew in the first place. But nobody said anything. Idyllic relationships that were on wishlists burned and broken. I must be going. I feel numb, and it's beautiful, just like every single one of you stars in the sky, burning brighter than the others and directing my attention. To anyone who reads this, blessed be, and merry meet and merry part and possibly merry meet again. Goodnight.",
        "response": "bipolar disorder. Reasoning: The post contains several references to symptoms commonly associated with bipolar disorder, such as experiencing episodes of depression and mania. The speaker mentions feeling depressed at a young age, hearing chants of \"bipolar,\" being hospitalized in a psych ward, and feeling like they have experienced both roaring floods and desert-dry droughts in their life. They also refer to their \"future-vision,\" which suggests a belief in premonitions or heightened intuition, a common trait associated with bipolar disorder. Overall, the post paints a picture of the individual's struggle with bipolar disorder and its impact on their life.",

Mind you, this is not because I don't want to do the work or because I am not smart enough to do the work, I just can't do the work. That's just academics though. Outside, I guess I'm doing decently socially, though I have no love life and no proof that anyone ever liked me. I started seeing a psychologist for help, but I don't trust him and he basically is making things worse (great guy, just not for me). Anyway, across the board I'm being crushed. The only thing that makes me want to hold on is my family and friends. They all know how tough my life is and they'd probably blame themselves if I killed myself.

The individual mentions seeking help from a psychologist but not trusting them and feeling that they are making things worse, which suggests a lack of effective support. The post concludes with thoughts of suicide and a clear concern for the impact it would have on their family and friends.

Now What? - 28/M/USA My entire life I've always had a bit of OCD/Hypochondria, but I've never had major physical reactions. Just small little ticks, fixating thoughts, and unnecessary worries...but like I said, I've never had any major breakdowns/etc. Any anxiety I've had normally last for 10-15 seconds then goes away. I had a few health scares this year but after further follow ups, I'm completely okay. But, those stressors really triggered some anxiety and fixating thoughts over the last month on unnecessary health problems. On Saturday (12/16) I popped my neck sideways and immediately got light headed afterwards. We were on our way to a Christmas party and throughout the entire party I felt random tingling in my head, I kept leaving the party and walking around outside (which made me feel better). My heart was racing, head felt tingly, and my fingers felt numb. **After feeling like I was going to pass out and die** (on and off for 3 hours) my wife drove me to the ER. After thorough testing at the hospital, it was ruled as an anxiety attack. For example, here are all the tests I've had this year to confirm my “healthy” status. - EKG (ER - 12/17 - Clear) - Echocardiogram (Dr - 11/17 - Clear) - Tilt Table Test (Dr - 11/17 - Clear) - CBC (ER - 12/17 - Clear) - CMP (ER - 12/17 - Clear) - CT Scan of Neck (Dr - 11/17 - Clear) - CT Scan of Abdomen/Pelvis (Dr - 11/17 - Clear) - MRI of Head (Dr - 5/17 - Clear) - Doppler Ultrasound of Neck (ER - 12/17 - Clear) The ER gave my Ativan that night and I went home and passed out...but now I've been experiencing constant WAVES of the feeling I had on Saturday night. **I feel broken.** My current symptoms include - - My head doesn't feel clear at times (Light Headed / Numbness / Tingling / Tension / Random Ice Pick Pain) - Random heart palpitations - Feeling “off” at times (fatigue) - Eyesight doesn't feel clear at times (almost like when you've started at a computer for too long and look up and your eyes are tired) - Random nausea after eating - Random tingling/aches in arms/legs Now, the hypochondriac in me is freaking out thinking there's something physically wrong with me...but I'm starting to realize this could be anxiety. **Could all this be from anxiety which is resulting in the physical symptoms above**? I've never dealt with this before and I'm trying to get it under control. I'm trying to drink more water, control my breathing, and exercise more. I spoke with a Psychologist for the first time yesterday and I'm trying to face this head on...but obviously there's times I “feel great” and other times where I feel “low” and that I'm going to pass out and have some sort of sickness.

They have high hopes in me, deep down inside I'm the downer on myself. I am starting to think that what I have gone through is all but a sham, that I've been a fool and not knowing what I course really wanted. As I recall I was influenced or perhaps moved by the people around me that had created an idea into me that this decision is what is to be chosen for they have interest in. I am scared that when I get out of this, all professors who put lots of efforts to teach me will be very disappointed. Am I a people-plaeser? I don't know what to do.

Yes, I realize that I am still young and not knowing everything, I am afraid that they might say things that I would expect to hear it negatively from them. My life moves with the people and their opinion matters to me, I hate this attitude. I became focused to other's commentary than my my own.

I hate my job. I know it's a cliche. But I _hate_ it. I'm the primary breadwinner and literally the only thing that keeps this family afloat. And it's killing me and I'm killing me because I'm eating crap and not doing anything to make it better. My job is literally a hindrance to human evolution. All I do is talk unimaginative and incurious morons through installing email on devices I can't afford. Every day, 30-50 calls, saying the same things over and over, begging the people that phoned _ME_ to _please listen to the words I'm saying_ and to _do the things I ask_. But I need to spend the first 10 minutes of each call _proving_ to these troglodytes that I know what I'm doing. I make nothing. I change nothing. I often speak to the same people several times a day, because they screw things up after the call ends. At the end of the day when I leave, all I have done is log a fuck-ton of calls we don't even charge for. I am Sisyphus. And if I stop pushing this rock for one second, my family loses everything. I need to get out. But I'm useless. I can't think straight. And all I want is a connection to _someone_. My messages to my friends go unanswered, my attempts at finding middle-ground with my co-workers fall flat, talks with my SO just end with \"It's going to be okay.\" And I don't think it will. I can't see how. I get so angry when she says that. But I can't let her know. She's barely holding on as it is. She has three degrees and can't find a job. I have no degree and I make almost double the country average. The situation would be comical if it wasn't making my life hell. I keep thinking about self-destructing.

We hit it off so much that we were official a week and a half after that, which I've come to realize is too fast for any relationship. But it continued to be great, until a week ago when they told me they loved me... this is after knowing me for 3 weeks and I immediately was worried. But I thought “hey, just cause I don't love them right now doesn't mean I won't in the future”. Which was also a bad idea, because instead of continuing to feel romantic about all I can think about when we spend time together is how they love me and I don't know when I'd be able to love them back. All this is compounded by the fact that the whole relationship they've put me on a pedestal, which makes me really uncomfortable. To give context: they've basically never dated a decent human being until me, so I feel like they think I'm some special angel sent from the heavens when I'm not! I'm just a person who is nice to their partner, and it makes it really hard to accept their love, compliments, and affection for doing just being decent. It's not that I don't want them to be nice to me, but I feel like they go above and beyond because they think I go above and beyond... when I'm not. For example, I was letting them stay the night because they had work early in the morning and I live close to their job. I had to go to work for a bit so I let them stay at my apartment while I was at work, and they cleaned my kitchen and did my dishes... I didn't ask them to do that, nor did ask me to do that, and it makes me uncomfortable when other people clean my mess for me. I feel like an asshole though because here I have this awesome, loving person who is devoted to me. But I also just feel trapped because I can't give them the love they deserve because I'm not in love with them and I don't think I ever will be at this point. If it was just the “I love you” too early, or the pedestal I could talk to them and reconcile. But together it's a deadly combo, and I don't think I want to continue this relationship. I'm gonna break up with them tonight somehow, it's just a matter of right time and place, but it's def happening tonight. It's just terrifying because I don't want to let them down or hurt them, but I know I have too because keeping up the charade would hurt them even more.

Well i think it began when my psychiatrist started to forget to give me new appointments that i thought to hell with it and started **working out and doing meditation** whilst lowering my daily dose. Many of my bad habits where kinda obvious, **weed and nicotine** for example. I had zero motivation and i felt like i walked 3 metres behind my body sometimes. Enforcing the habit to **keep my apartment clean** is something i am working on, i began punishing myself when for example i threw a used sock on the floor instead of in the basket i had to find three similar tasks to correct in my apartment.

Went from running from the cold to hunting it down. Also something that's a bit controversial for many is that i did some of the **nofap challenge** for the energy boost mostly and i feel that i've reached my goal to masturbate only for healthy release on the seldom occasion rather than trying to cure mindless boredom. I took up **reading books** again, sure made me restless in the start since it was so long ago so i picked some lightweight books that i have read before. Harry Potter for example. When i feel down i listen to music and almost go **full retard by miming everything** instead of singing them, love songs are hilarious to mime.

At that point I just sort of gave up, I became severely depressed and just smoked weed to try and get over my problems. That was four years ago. I've worked a lousy job only a few days a week, living with my parents and doing literally nothing but smoking and playing video games, all the while pretending that I'm mentally okay. Most of my friends from high school are gone and really only two are left, I have more online but I wouldn't say I'm that close to any of them. I never really tried to get help... something I immensely regret every single day. I'm like my father, he doesn't talk about or express his emotions to others. Trying to talk with me about my emotions is like talking to a brick wall. It's always been easier for me to just ignore my feelings and just escape by smoking or playing video games, or watching something. I've dreaded the thought about talking about my emotions to my parents and others... but I realize now I have to. I've already wasted so much of my life... I'm only 22, but the last four years have just been an utter waste. I've made a bit of money but I've done literally nothing, it's just been the same exact thing every week. I feel so much regret and self-hate for what I've done... I'm not suicidal, but I do wish I didn't exist, that I was just never born in the first place. If my life continues like this, I will no doubt turn suicidal eventually. Already I sometimes feel urges to hurt myself... So, today I will be opening up to my best friend about how I've felt. He's been depressed in the past, quite a long time ago as he's in a much better place now with a girlfriend. But I know he cares about me, and I think he can understand how I feel, even if just a little. What I'm really worried about is telling my mother... she is bi-polar and often worries a lot, this is mostly why I've kept my feelings a secret for so long. Telling her and talking about my emotions is going to be incredibly hard, but I have to do this. I'm going to quit my job this week, just the thought of that feels liberating, I can start trying to get help and maybe, just maybe I can try to go to university next year... If not, the year after that. I'm so scared to open up after all this isolation... I don't know if I can. It's so hard for me to explain just how I feel even on here. The song And All That Could Have Been by Nine Inch Nails can better explain how I feel than I ever could, but a warning it is an incredibly depressing song... I attach particular meaning to it as it I listened to it an awful lot when my girlfriend broke up with me, I can hardly ever listen to it because of how depressed it makes me. I would greatly appreciate any advice with opening up about my feelings, I'm confused where to even begin... For a long time I've felt like it's been too late to get help, but I want to believe that isn't true. As much as I wish I was dead my life can't end like that. Thank you all for listening, I really hope today can be the start of some real change, I can't push it off any longer.",
        "response": "depression. Reasoning: The post contains several indications of depression.

Basically I'm undergoing massive depression at the moment and it's difficult to reconcile the kind of person I was and the kind of person I want to be, with all the shit that has happened to me throughout. No worries, there will be a massive TL;DR at the end, so you can skip all of my heartwrenching shit if you'd like. So uh, where do I start? The Beginning? I guess. I have wanted to write a book about this but the thought of painstakingly writing every shitty thing that happened to me and then editing it and then telling publishers about the shit that has happened to me is well... frightening to say the least. At least here I have some sort of anonymity (inb4 not burner account... I've made concessions for myself) that can cushion the blow of who I am and what I've done and what has been done to me. I was six when the spiral began. A wee babe, living in an apartment, who enjoyed watching who framed roger rabbit at least 6 times a day (I still can, its fucking classic!) and generally enjoyed peanut butter cookies and batman. I was poor, I would yell outside the apartment that, \"We have FUCKING COCKROACHES!!!!\", and promptly be told to STFU by a neighbour. Good times. Did I mention my mother was a prostitute? Yeah she was a prostitute for a living and I ended up being told to stay quiet in the bedroom while she assuaged her clients in the living room. No... I was being assuaged. She was \"massaging\" her clients in the living room. I had no idea what was going on, all I knew is that I was being told to be quiet and I was quite bored at the time. Well on fine brisky day, she had a request from a client. That client was wanting to see an incestuous and paedophilic situation between mother and son. Still had no idea what was going on, except I was in the living room and the man was on the phone, and I was allowed to ask for a ridiculous amount of money. I was just throwing numbers around. I mean hell, I was 6! I had no idea what was going on! Nothing came of that.. except... the day shit happened. I remember a lot of things about my childhood, other places, other people, but I'm not really here to focus on that. I'm here to focus on the shit that has happened to me. And honestly, I was forced to have sex with my mother. Yeah, guess what, boys and men get sexually assaulted and raped all the fucking time, and nobody really pays attention to it which bewilders me beyond belief. I remember it like it was yesterday, while it being simultaneously just blurry af, which I kind of prefer to be perfectly honest. My mother actually has a conscience (thank god) and in a cocaine haze moment of clarity, turned herself in. She was put on probation, and I was placed to foster care. From the age of six to fifteen, I was in about 4 homes, which wasn't too bad, except for the first home that kept me locked in my bedroom with bars on the window and I had to knock on the door to take a piss. Luckily that only lasted 6 months, but I am past that now. Now that I think about it, I've always had issues shitting, and I realise why. Poop and abuse seem to go hand in hand, at the very least I wasn't flinging it everywhere like a fucking monkey that's been trapped. I'm going to fast forward a bit because I needed to make the point of what shaped my adolescence, whether I was conscious of it or not. Not as a justification, but rather a context of how it has shaped my behaviour towards others. Fast forward to about age.... 12? I used to sleepover at my grandmothers every weekend as respite.

I recovered once, which lasted around a few months, but it came back 7 months ago and has stayed till then. I started taking antidepressants like 2 months ago. First two weeks I took 5mg of Escitalopram a day. My doctor then told my to take 2 a day for the third week. I then ran out of them and haven't bothered to collect them again. Nothing happen when I was on them. No changes. I still feel the same. The doctor said he'd set me up for counselling but he told me this a little over a month ago and I still haven't gotten any messages or anything about it. I called the Suicide hotline once before they're the ones who encouraged me to see a doctor but that didn't help out much. So I'm feeling extremely, extremely hopeless. I just want to die so bad. For many reasons. I haven't been on my antidepressants in a month because tbh I don't care about anything anymore, I don't have the motivation to collect it and have lost all hope. I had an argument with my mum today. She tends to go high street a lot. As a mother I feel like it should be her duty to take care of her children. But she doesn't give a crap about me or any of her other kids. I confronted her about this but she keeps saying “It's too far.” “I don't go near the pharmacy” It's seriously only a 2 minute a walk from where she shops. After that things got heated and I ended up shouting at her telling her I hated her and that I wished her and my father hadn't had sex. Like wow. You don't care for your own daughters mental health? Okay. That two minute walk would've stopped me from overdosing today. Anyways I got extremely mad at her. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Suicide as I have been for the past 7 months. I was constantly crying in bed. Then I just decided to try to overdose. I started off with one by one tablet of Cuprofen Maximum strong (ibuprofen 400g) till I had 8 all together. Which adds up to 3,200 mg. I'm really hoping to die. I'm no longer afraid to die. Also I absolutely refuse to go hospital. Even if I do end up with long term damage. It'll be punishment to myself for not having killed myself already. This is the first time I've ever really attempted suicide. I must've finished taken them about an hour ago. I can taste a bit of vomit down my through and bit of stomach pain. Also I'm extremely tempted to have more. I have like 18 left. I haven't slept yet and I have 2 hours left before I have to wake up for work. Yay me. Edit: it's been 6 hours later and I took 4 more in one go. 12 all together. Contemplating on going hospital...

She opened up by saying she had been reading these performance reports and honestly my performance isn't so great because I work all the terrible shifts that no one else wants to work - the crazy understaffed ones, the incredibly busy ones. So I knew my scores weren't good at all. But then she went on to say that she was impressed with me and my work and all that I'm doing and that she had decided to give me a BIG ASS RAISE!!!! I was so shocked I just sat there and looked at my GM and almost cried because then they both told me how proud they were of me and how much of an asset I was and how much they relied on me and how impressed they were by all of the work I've been doing (running myself ragged, basically, and taking on a lot of tasks that no one else in the store can really do, like becoming the technology manager, etc) and wow it felt so great to be validated. so so so great. she spent 10 minutes telling me how well my GM spoke of me and how impressed she was and how grateful they are that i am working there and helping them. she said she wanted to show me how much she appreciates me by giving me a raise, and also sitting me down because i guess they've realized how important positive reinforcement is to me and i am still stunned because even though this happened hours ago i am still in that wishy washy close to tears phase because i have been so stressed about my finances and feeling so down about how much work i've been doing and I've been considering leaving for an easier job only because it takes a lot out of me physically but wow. these people have asked a lot of me but they also have believed in me every step of the way and no one's ever believed in me like that before. i hadn't even ever heard my own family talk about me like that so for them to really recognize how hard i've been working is just amazing. it's astounding. i am so happy. my GM pulled me aside and let me know later that I'm not allowed to tell any of the other managers, because i'm the only one to have gotten a raise, and it's more of a raise than any of the other managers have gotten in awhile.

As I was talking, I was getting angrier and angrier and it ended up inducing a panic attack. My whole body went numb and I kept telling my grandmother that I couldn't breathe in between gasping for air.

After some back and forth about that, I decided to come clean about my disorder and my seeking therapy. I expected her to dismiss me like my parents, but surprisingly, she did the exact opposite. She said I shouldn't feel ashamed about it and that God answered her prayers by giving me the strength and knowledge to recognize the issue and get help for it (I'm not religious but the sentiment was really sweet).

I was in a relationship with a girl in college and we dated for about a month and a half. We both have anxiety and depression so we understood each other well. But I ended things because felt like it wasn't going to work our and we weren't super compatible. I also kept worrying of it was right or not, and that just made my anxiety awful and made me more depressed, and I think I may have just been lonely and upset with my life. She is a great person who is very kind and understanding and quirky. I worried I won't find someone like her who's as goofy or quirky, even though some of her idiosyncrasies annoyed me. We remained friends right after without any NC. That was a mistake bc I became emotionally dependent on her and it messed with us both. She kept trying to get back together with me, but some part of me knew it wasn't a good idea or I just needed more time to figure things out. A month later, I learned she slept with another guy and just got really jealous and freaked out. I tried to get back together with her even though I knew it wasn't a good idea. She said no because it was too late and said I wasn't ready for a relationship, but she still wants to be friends eventually. I think partially I wanted her to end things too bc that month wasn't healthy for us. But I hope we can be friends. But now I can't stop thinking about her and being jealous and regretting losing her because I've built her up in my head so much that she's a better person than me. And now I think she's seeing someone and she's in my friend group so I see them together. I keep thinking I'm a piece of shit and worthless and I fucked up. I want to stop obsessing but I can't. I blocked her on Snapchat and she blocked me back. I don't look at her social media, but my thoughts are spiraling. Even though I have good friends, I jealous of hers because they are good people, like mine, but they're with her. I feel like I'm awful because she is in a living learning community who are all proactive in society and I just feel apathetic towards anything and feel more like shit because of that. And I just feel so much jealousy seeing her with someone. It doesn't make sense even though I know we we weren't compatible. But I feel bad bc I lied when I was trying to get her back, and I hope she doesn't think I'm a piece of shit for dragging her along hoping she would wait.

Looming big life changes are an issue for me and I can't tell if this is the Bipolar talking, or if it's \"normal\", or maybe somewhere in between. For example: Before I had been properly diagnosed and medicated, my boyfriend and I decided to move in together. I waffled on this decision a lot...going back and forth not being able to say \"yes\" even though I knew I really wanted to do it. As soon as I would settle down with \"yes\", a day would go by and all of a sudden I was terrified that I was making the wrong decision. Ultimately, we've been living together for over 6 months now and I am SO glad we went down this path. If I had to go back and do it all over again, I absolutely would! Currently I am on zoloft and wellbutrin. No mood stabilizer at this time. The bf and I have been discussing and semi-planning getting married. Most of the time, I am 100% on board with this plan.

Because I KNOW that when I don't feel \"moodily unbalanced\", I do NOT have these concerns at all! I hate that this is happening! WHY???

It really pulls the rug out from under me and has caused me tons of issues in relationships. I cannot trust my gut anymore and I'm sure this plays into the problem as well.

I just want to go over how much of a degenerate I am because I have nothing left to do. - I am 28 in a couple of days and I still live with my parents. They are making dealing with depression, anxiety and ibs difficult. I hope to move out this year but it depends if I can get a loan and if my anxiety stays in check. - I can't drive. I drive to work every day sure, but its a five minute drive down a back road. I cannot deal with busy traffic or towns, it is just too much for me to take in at once. So I have to get my parents to get me fuel at the gas station. I don't know how I am going to get by when they stop doing it. - I have been taking codeine for a long time, possibly up to five years. I take one before work every day and often take another at lunch time if I am feeling ill. I have ibs so the doctors recommended I take them and they just keep giving me more subscriptions. I think it has completely messed my body up, so I wanted to go off them during my X mas break. Each time I stop taking them for two days I get really ill on the third. I made it up to five days before I went back on them because I was really ill and my parents were complaining. So I am stuck on a hardcore drug that I have been abusing to be able to work for years. - I am saving for a house but for my age I have hardly any money in the bank. When I started working many years ago I was a bit loose with my money, buying lots of games and equipment. I am forever going to be behind on savings. - I hardly ever tidy my room. There are always clothes everywhere and dust on the bookshelves. I always tell myself I will do it one day but it never happens. - I have not had any friends since 2002, the last year of primary school. Since I started high school in 2003 I have been alone. - I have OCD and a bad memory. I will do something and then a minute later I won't be able to remember if I did it or not. And when I leave the house I stress about the fridge being closed and taps being off and the iron etc. And adding bad memory to OCD means I cannot remember the state of something a second after I check it. - I hardly do any food prep or cooking. I only do very basic stuff, but even then if I can get away with it I just have the most lazy meal ever. For lunch I have been just eating some fruit and cheese. I am a filthy degenerate. - I'm the most lazy mofo ever and it is the thing that annoys me the most about living with myself. I want to be a busy person but I don't have any energy. I am soo slow. I don't have any time management either. I have wanted to make Youtube videos for a decade but anytime I start I just do the bare minimum and give up. There is a mental block that stops me from working hard. I'm a compulsive lazy person. All I want to do is sit there watching Youtube and doing nothing. I never get bored of it for some reason. - I loath my job, I have been there for five years and it is a nightmare. Whats worse is that last year my boss screwed me and my workmate over and is taking away our roles. We are going from IT administrators to BYOD techs, and I can't stand BYOD. I don't even know that much about phones or tablets. I start back in two days and I don't think I can do it anymore, I have not been keeping up with my studies and so I am starting to suck at IT.

I was patient and took my time to make sure I was prepared for success. The problem is, a policy change made it nearly impossible for me to succeed. I spent four years of my life based on this policy and I was on my path towards becoming a doctor. I left everything to pursue this. I had a perfect career path, beautiful girlfriend, great reputation, and was on my way to completing all of my dreams. I was one step from success but I quit and now I have no chance of getting it back. I have 100,000 in debt, no job available, and I'm in an impossible situation. The rest of my cohort has gone on to medical school, and I'm 28 and stuck in my parents house settling. I had everything I wanted but I lost it. I moved halfway across the country with no research experience and ended up in a position where I was breeding rats for brain surgery and subsequently decapitating them. I went from an immensely happy individual with emergency services experience to a sociopath breeding and killing animals in the middle of nowhere. All for a paid masters degree that would have led me to medical school. My classmates projects entailed growing cells in petri dishes while I'm doing intense brain work with lab animals. I left everything to go back to school and this policy eliminated absolutely any chance of success. I'm so depressed and dysfunctional. I was a chubby kid growing up and had worked myself into a six-pack, great grades, and the world at my feet. All of that until someone changed a rule with no warning. I have constant thoughts of suicide. I was removed from my program for mental health and all that did was make it worse. I can't think anymore. I'm trapped in the past because my dreams were taken from me. I just wish there was something to blame. A sickness that took everything from me, or an accident. But its simply that a policy was changed and destroyed my career. I was the happiest asshole on the planet, now I'm so depressed I can't function. I lost my job, girlfriend, reputation, career, and I'm now in immense debt. I want to live, but I want my dreams back. I want my health back. I am in a program to complete a lesser version of my prior goals, but its settling for less and I'm so depressed that I can't think. My performance is great, but I'm so alone I can't focus. My depression makes no one want to be around me. Throughout my life, I've become bilingual, saved lives, built houses, and held just about every job looking for my purpose. I found my purpose and had it taken from me. I was in love with who I was. Now, because someone changed a rule, I can't function. I was in a master's program performing well until this rule was changed. I started having meltdowns and my mental health caused me to burn bridges. Ultimately led to suicidal thoughts that had me removed from the program. I hastily went to another program without seeking proper treatment and the new program is incredibly stressful. People are failing out left and right. Basically the hunger games version of academics. To put the cherry on the cake, there is a discrepancy on my application that could lead to rejection. I'm paranoid someone is out to fuck me over, I'm in debt, and I'm in a furnace of stress. I want out, and in today's world it seems like the only way out is suicide. The memories, the what-ifs, the what should-have-beens, are all destroying me. Its the first thing I think about when I wake up, and I cannot produce anything aside from ruminating. I'm dead inside and I feel like a joke. I had everything, and I lost it all. I had my career ruined by someone changing a rule. I'd love to go do something else, but 100,000 of debt doesn't really permit it. I have no emergency fund. I have multiple plans of suicide. I'm immensely ashamed of myself.

Hey guys, this is my first post on reddit . so i really dont know how this works but im told to \"speak your mind\" so here it goes.a little information about myself, Im in high school and next year will be my last year. so far this year, 2017 has been utter shit. first of all,this post isnt about my ex girlfriend but i will give a little backstory of how it went down. At the start of the year me and my girlfriend broke up. we dated for a year and she was my 2nd girlfriend. i thought i could handle it pretty well thinking that i learned how to deal with things after my first heartbreak, but it still hit me hard. in fact, it was even more painful than my first heartbreak. we actually broke up during october 2016 but continued talking after that and trying to fix things until late january of 2017. we both knew it wouldnt work out so we decided to just move on. moving on was hard but i tried to and i did it, or at least i think i did. See, after we decided to move on it was during february. even after we decided on that, we still had small talks and sometimes even say things that \"friends\" arent suppose to say. i still talked to her on and off until june, where i just stopped because i felt like i would never get over her and the best way is to stop talking to her. so i did, and we did not talk. for awhile. it was during late june where i got a new phone and installed snapchat. i started a streak with almost all the contacts i had in my phone. ( to make new friends and talk to people ) tho i did not send one to my ex of course. But, i did send one to one of my ex's \"best friend\" ( i highlighted bestfriend because apparently they fought before and they arent that close anymore) but anyways, we'll call her L. L would most of the time reply to my snapstreaks and from then on, we would have a casual conversation. it went on for about two or three weeks till my ex found out. she found and she was not happy about me and L talking. I told my ex that me and L we just good friends. and we were! nothing more. (well at the time) see, i never expected i would ever EVER fall for L. I just saw her as a really nice girl but nothing more. Though, the more i talked to L and the more we got to know each other, i slowly had a small crush on her. which i tried to shrug it off. Me and L were aware of my ex not okay with us talking. and i wouldnt want to be that guy who ruins a friendship .so, i asked L to talk to My ex. and they talked and my ex was okay with me and L talking. We were just friends anyways. So me and L talked ALOT. every night we would snap each other. we made so many inside jokes and nicknames for each other. it was cute. then my ex one day came to me and told me that \" i really hope you and L dont end up more than friends.\" i told \" dont worry, we're just friends\" and after that me and my ex never talked again. so i just continued to talking to L. We talked alot on snapchat until we had those two pink hearts. still, at the time, i just saw her as a friend. Until one night i asked if she was free to call. and she said yes! amd we called. and we called for HOURS. and ohmygod. atfter i ended the call with her i think i had a huge crush on her. i fell in love with her personality and her likenessess. she has great taste in music and very humble and kind. But, i was aware of how my ex would react. and my friends told me to go for it and not care about what your ex thinks. anyways, i went up to my ex and told her that i might have feelings for L. and she was TOTALLY AGAINST IT. so i did not what to do then. we kinda fought and just stopped talking so i just continued talking to L. and ohmygod we started calling everynight during august. we even hangout with each other at school, well not most of the time, but there are the times. and her friends were giving hints that they know about me and L and said how c",

        "query": "My longest day. Someone please read this. Anyone. About a year ago I texted a suicide crisis hotline that I have used for the past 6 months and I told them I was feeling suicidal. I told them I had pills and a knife and was planning to end my life. I was very disoriented so there were a lot of gaps in between my responses, which worried the responder I was talking to. He stopped responding after a while and I texted saying \"Where did you go\" and he replied with \"Getting you the help you need\". My heart immediately sank and I had the closest thing to a panic attack I've ever experienced. I called the police myself to try to cancel the emergency intervention but they told me I'd had to speak with the officer in person once they arrived. I was terrified at the idea of police showing up to my apartment building, since I still live with my family. So I went down to the lobby to wait for them to show up so I could tell them to leave. It was around 11 pm and I told my mom I was going downstairs to check the laundry. 10 minutes later, the police car pulled up to the front and I let the officers in. I wanted to talk to them at the door but they insisted on sitting down with me in the sitting area of the lobby. There were 4 of them, 2 men and 2 women, though one of the women looked younger and wasn't in uniform, maybe a trainee or something. They told me to recount what happened and asked me about my mental state. I tried to tell them everything was okay so they'd leave, but they weren't buying it. They said they wouldn't leave until they knew I'd be safe. I knew my mom would come looking for me soon but no matter what I said, I couldn't convince the police to leave. After about 15 minutes, my mother came down to the lobby and saw me sitting with the officers. Naturally, her first reaction was fear and shock. She thought I had something​ wrong. She asked me what was happening and I thought the police might explain it for me, but they stayed quiet and let me do it. So with my voice faltering and my body shaking, I explained as best I could in broken sentences in my mom's native language, which I'm terrible at. She didn't believe what I was saying so the officers had to reiterate what I had said. It took her a while to process and she just couldn't grasp the situation. So one officer pulled her aside and talked to her in private. Meanwhile, the one female officer was telling me how common suicide calls were, how they got at least one every shift, and how there is no shame in reaching out. She was really kind but I was hardly listening though because I was trying to hear what my mom was saying across the room. She was angry. It took a long time for everything to settle down, and at one point it seemed like they were finally about to leave. But then the police officer asked to see the texts on my phone before they left, and my heart dropped again. I had been using the textline for the past 6 months and there were 750+ back and forth texts that I never deleted. I knew what would happen if I showed them those texts. I would be hauled off to a mental ward ASAP. But even in spite of that, part of me wanted to do it. Part of me wanted somebody to see the pain I've been carrying for the past year. So after a long internal struggle, I handed the phone over and waited as they scrolled through months of backlog. And sure enough, the officers tell me that they no longer feel comfortable leaving me there. We went upstairs so I could grab my coat. They were taking me to the hospital. The one officer told me to bring my phone charger, which I understood to mean I would be there for the night. They came into the house, and they told the rest of my family that they were here to get me help. It was embarrassing, and I wish they hadn't come inside. I went down with them alone and got into their car after being searched for weapons. While being driven in the backseat of the car, I received a text on my phone. My mom was telling me to say that nothing happened. That it was just a joke, or that I had gotten confused. In that moment I wanted to die more than ever before. We rode the nearby hospital, had a quick pre-evaluation before being",

        "query": "How do I go on? So I've always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, I'm a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but I'll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. Now these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. As the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didn't want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. I've hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. It may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I can't wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare. I'm having a hard time finding myself again and although its a new year, I'll be going back to school soon and will soon meet them again. I have tried over the break to strengthen myself again and not go down the same route of trying to commit to things I don't want to do etc this time but I'm not sure. How would you have done it?",

I know it's long, tl;dr at bottom I couldn't take it and walked out of work today. I have my own office. It's a high work high stress environment. My boss is out visiting a customer and doesn't micromanage me at all anyways. Because of all that, normally this is something I'd get away with unless there's a meeting scheduled or some shit breaks and I'm needed. Unfortunately, that also means that due to the information in the title, I've done this quite a lot and gotten by just fine. I've blown through all my time off due to a diagnosed/documented chronic illness. At this point a mix of that but mostly depression+anxiety overall keep me barely functioning. Sorry if this comes off sounding /r/iamverysmart, but for the sake of more venting, I need to point out that I am pretty brilliant. Not some top tier braniac but I've consistently been top percentile on any tests, had amazing grades despite dealing with all of this emotional baggage, and landed an amazing job right out of school along with some solid internships under my belt. The problem is that I've always skated by on smarts and when the chips are down I really think I'm lazy....sure I worked a couple jobs along with a couple internships in college and can do work when necessary....but 40-50 hours a week 5 days a week with barely any other time fucking kills me. I've started using a lot more drugs to cope with work and going in and dealing with people. But diminishing marginal returns are a very real principle. Today it all came to a head when no amount of uppers or downers was leveling me out. I had a meeting to run at 1. I had lunch with a customer at 12. I had a calls all morning...and you know what? I couldn't do it. I woke up late. Not something new. Debated quitting debated going in for a bit before I got up and dragged myself to the office with just enough time to read email before lunch with the customer.

After work we hit up a bar down the street to grab a beer, unwind and chat. There is a bartender there that she fell head over heals for quite quickly and so we started hanging out with her quite periodically too. First impressions of this girl, if a god did exist she is God's gift to Earth. She is strikingly beautiful, great personality, well spoken, funny, educated. No surprise that my friend is falling hard for this girl. First night hanging out with her she mentions that she is new to town.... Ok.... Little bit more intimate conversation she mentions that she had to move away from her old town because everyone there was blaming her for her then-fiance committing suicide when she came out as a lesbian to him. EXTREMELY heartbreaking yes. :/ So she's in our town now and has a girlfriend (not my friend) and I guess they moved in with each other immediately. Bartender became good friends with my coworker though and she always would complain to her about how rocky their relationship is. I find out last week that Bartenders girlfriend commited suicide by overdosing on pills. EXTREMELY HEARTBREAKING yes. Anyway, Bartender has a new girlfriend (still not my friend despite them being very close) before the funeral even happened. I'm assuming rushing into a new relationship is how she copes with losing someone so close. And this is where I start to get a little conspiracy theory crazy and I feel horrible for doing so. Either this woman has extremely horrible luck and falls in love with people that are on the verge of suicide or something else is at play here. I would never mention any of my suspicions to anyone I know, especially my coworker who is crushing hard on her, because that would make me seem like a crazy, insensitive douchebag. Which is why I'm just writing down my thoughts here.... But I kinda can't get it off my mind. Maybe I've watched to many movies but serial killers, or dare I say black widow in this case, are the ones with shining personalities that you'd least expect. A different co worker of mine has hung out with her quite a bit as well. She told me that Bartender told her that there have been 7 people in her life have commited \"suicide\". The plot may have just thickened? But I may disregard that number, could just be a rumor. Either this is the unluckiest woman alive and is a very strong woman trying to mover on with her life, and most likely is just a strong woman trying to move on with her life..... But there's may be a slight chance that she may be involved. Why would she be so up front with these deaths if she had something to hide? Possibly being in the light is the best disguise. Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm just rambling on now. I just hope my friend doesn't become part of a possibly staged suicide.",

I wrote a letter I will never send, so I'm posting it here to get it off my chest. Dear Mrs. Ugly Thug, I am writing to you as a woman who will be turning 50 next spring, but who still remembers your part in the most humiliating day of my childhood. Whether you knew it or not, I was relentlessly bullied by a girl we'll call “Slimebag” and her two bffs. It began in the third grade. Slimebag led the group and made fun of me, sometimes spit at me, and ridiculed my clothes, my hair, and my face. She cornered me every chance she got. Unbeknownst to them, I had nowhere to turn. My parents were not supportive, and in fact, if I reported anything untoward, I would be immediately blamed. There was an atmosphere of fear at home. My father left when I was 11, but while he was there, whatever happened was my fault. So, with that explanation of my home life, you might see that regardless of what happened at school, I had no recourse at home. Slimebag upped her bullying with each new school year, to the point where I wished I was dead. I dreaded going to school. I dreaded every single day. On the day of which I speak, our seventh-grade class had some kind of activity at the public playground. Slimebag came at me and punched me hard in the stomach. In that moment, I punched her back. One of the teachers saw me and pulled me out of the activity and sent me packing back to the school, a short distance away. I felt humiliated, small, and lonely, in front of my classmates, but it was about to get worse. I tried to jump over a mud puddle and I slipped and fell on my ass. I hurried back to the school building and went into the girls' room. I tried to remove as much mud as I possibly could to blend in with my returning classmates, and not suffer any further humiliation. Because, really, who had seen me fall, or run away in shame? I thought the horror was over. But it wasn't. 12-year-old me, in her haste to erase the mud and her shame left, no doubt, a fair amount of mud on the sink in which I washed off my legs, my skirt, my arms, my face, and my blouse. I returned to the classroom, thankful that no one had witnessed this latest shame. But then you came charging into the classroom and said WHO IS THE PIG WHO LEFT ALL THAT MUD IN THE GIRLS ROOM? I WANT IT CLEANED UP NOW!! Of course, there was no doubt “which pig” had left all that mud in the girls room, since I was still covered in it. I got out of my seat, in front of my classmates, and a laughing Slimebag, and left the room to clean that bathroom until it shined. When I got home, I attempted suicide. Obviously, I did not succeed. You were not a role model, nor a good teacher; but, I hope you are a better wife, mother, and grandmother. I also hope that nobody else ever experienced your total lack of character, let alone, your utter lack of compassion in the way I did. Regards, GraniteMark",

Everywhere you read and hear about acceptance, accept it's there, ease with it etc. You should let the dreadful feelings be there until it peaks and decreases. And it seems this is the only way.

I only get relief when I am able to focus on something else which is VERY VERY hard when you are heavily anxious, right?

My parents are unable to help me, I've tried dental schools, and I don't qualify for medicaid. I'm missing a front tooth, have been for over 3 years now. I have a temporary filling in my front tooth, another front tooth is broken in half and looks like shit. I've been told \"it gets better\" and bullshit like that, but it hasn't. I've been waiting for years for it to \"get better\" and it hasn't. I hate how I'm living. I hate that everyday I think about how different my life would be if I had halfway decent looking teeth. I'm embarrassed by my teeth. Any time I smile, I quickly find a way to cover my teeth up so nobody sees them. As a 19 year old college student, I can't take any more of this. It's only going to get worse when I have no way to get them fixed. I've never had a girlfriend, never asked a girl out to be honest, and I won't as long as I look the way I do. I don't feel like I can be happy the way I am, sure I can have an uplifting moment here and again, but I'm not happy. Everything I see just reminds me of my teeth and how messed up they are. I don't know what to do, I've been stuck like this for years and it really doesn't feel like it's getting better any time soon.",

I do understand how mania drives motivation and creativity, but it also drives irresponsibility and irrational behavior. And it is during this arc of our illness that we tend to do the most harm to ourselves and those we love. I joined this sub so that I could learn from others and hopefully provide advice.

Hello, This place has brought me a lot of comfort and peace in the last few days, so first of all let me thank you for that. I now feel the need to post on my own because I have to reach out for help. Any insight or experience with what I'm dealing with will be much appreciated. This may be kind of long to tell you what's going on. I've (29 year old female) been coming off of my meds since around June. That's around when I had my first chest pain scare. My grandfather died of a heart attack when he was 39, so it's very freaky to think about that. I went to the ER where they did all the tests, EKG, X Ray, Bloodwork, and I was fine. They gave me an Atavan and sent me home. (I do not have any benzos, never been prescribed) I was on Pristiq and Lamotrigine. Completely stopped the lamotrigine over a month ago. I am now taking 25mg of Pristiq a day and that's it. I have struggled with immense anxiety for the past month. I've been extremely stressed out for a number of reasons I won't go into. In the last few weeks the chest pain problem has been back in full force, seemingly out of nowhere. I went to the ER again when I was up visiting my family for Christmas and got the same results. (This was a week an a half ago) They went away again after that, although came and went briefly at different times. Now I'm back home (600 miles away, all by myself, my boyfriend is still out of town) and the chest pains are back and have been rapidly coming and going for almost 2 full days now. I REALLY don't want to go to the ER again but I don't understand why the pains won't go away? And sometimes it's not even really a PAIN but just a tightness or tingling sensation. It's never lasted this long before nor has it been this intense. I'm thinking it's because I'm all by myself that the paranoia and anxiety is amplified. And my only friend here is out of town too until next Thursday. I called my psych but he can't get me in until next Friday. I guess my question to you all is: has anyone had a PHYSICAL chest pain/numbness/tingling panic attack where symptoms have continued on for many days? Should I go to the ER again? I really can't afford it at all but I don't want to die. If they checked me last week and said everything was fine then there's no reason to go back? I don't know, I just need some reassurance from someone who has been in this position. It just won't go away and I don't know what to do, I have seriously tried everything I can think of. Thank you to anyone who can advise.",

The individual expresses fear and concern about their symptoms and seeks reassurance and advice from others who may have been in a similar position.

It'll be a vent: So I've just been thinking about that. I think my anxiety really started 3 years ago when I went to college, started living on my own, being responsible for the apartment, the rent, groceries and all that stuff. And I obsessed that I'm pathetic, can't do all of that, constantly worried if I paid the rent, electricity or blamed myself for buying too expensive stuff to eat, to wear etc. Then I started dating a guy who turned out to be a narcissistic asshole who dated several girls at once. When with him, my obssesion was that he cheats on me (I didn't know that in the beginning, but suspected it), that this relationship is toxic and I can't end it, that I feel I'm falling in love with him though I'll never really be with him etc. Okay, so finally we broke up. So... My anxiety had to find a new obsession! Which was the new major that I took - I studied a lot, worried that I won't make it to the second semester. Of course I did, so here we go the next and present obsession which is: Relationships with other people, my parents, generally I think it evolved into social anxiety. So right now I can't sleep (it's 2am here), because I'm obsessing about the Christmas gifts I bought for my parents, I think the gift for my mum is much cooler and thought through than the one for my dad, but what concerns me the most is that mum will think that I've spent a lot money on her gift and everyone will be upset, because our financial situation is not very good and it would seem inappropriate to give each other expensive presents (They support me financially). When actually her gift costed as much as dad's, but it looks more expensive (I got eyeshadows and make up brushes for her, though they were not expensive, I bought them in my favourite drugstore. Dad will get a pair of santa socks and gloves in which you can use smartphone). It's nothing, right? But I don't have anyone close to me to whom I could talk about it and he or she would laugh and say \"Why do you worry about it, these are cool! I would never think that this one's not cool or that the other is too expensive, you really obsess too much\". I'm really waiting for something new for my anxiety to feed on, because obsessing about being a good daughter is exhausting.",

Reasoning: The post describes a pattern of obsessive thinking and anxious thoughts that have shifted from one topic to another, including concerns about fulfilling responsibilities, relationships, and social situations. The individual expresses difficulty sleeping due to obsessing over a perceived problem with Christmas gifts for their parents and a fear of being judged for spending too much money. These are all symptoms commonly associated with anxiety, such as excessive worry, obsession, and difficulty in letting go of anxious thoughts. The individual also mentions feeling exhausted from obsessing, which further supports the presence of an anxiety disorder.",

Some background, I'm 24 years old, and I was diagnosed with generalize anxiety disorder when I was 18, over the years I've learned how to control the symptoms. However, a few months ago I got a really bad cold, which left me with this cough that wouldn't go away, turns out my allergies were causing my to have \"asthma\" symptoms, even though I've never suffered from asthma before. I'm also an occasional smoker, so that probably didn't help either, although am not a heavy smoker, and haven't done it for longs periods of time. All of this background is to ask for advice: last night, I decided to smoke some weed, since I did it two days ago after years of not doing it and I forgot how good it feels. I only took two inhales, but the second one was quite strong and it burned a lot when I smoked, at the moment it didn't feel so bad, but as the minutes passed by I started feeling a lot of lack of air and heavy breathing. Clearly I started feeling stoned so I didn't know wether it was a real asthma related episode or anxiety getting worse because of the weed. The point is that I barely got some sleep, I used my inhaler a bit more than usual (nothing crazy though) and woke up this morning, I'm obviously now sober but I still have this difficulty breathing, however I can't tell if it's anxiety or asthma, I was wondering if anyone suffers from both and has a way of telling them apart?

I've had anxiety for 6 years since my mother died. Mainly agoraphobia around fear of going mental or embarrassing myself. I took sertraline in the past but had no startup issues. Recently I started to take it again after I got super anxious on a holiday Iceland and basically ruined it for myself and my girlfriend. I almost didn't catch the plane back from fear and thought I'd better start on a medication path again and sort my anxiety out. As soon as I got back I started meditation every day and sertraline. 25mg for a week and 50mg for another two weeks. I had some days of terrible anxiety and had to take a few days off work. 3 weeks into sertraline I'm meant to be going on a preplanned trip to Switzerland skiing, with girlfriend and some friends. But my head is all over the place. One minute I'm keen then really anxious the next. Feeling like a massive let down I bail on the trip and my girlfriend ropes in her sister at the last minute and they head off skiing. I spend the next few days with my head all over the place, for a few hours I will be super down and feel like such a failure. Then I will be excited and happy and think fuck yeah I'll just book a flight and catch up with the group midweek. Then I will get really dizzy and anxious and realise I'm not quite right yet and need to give the sertraline longer. Well tonight I saw a cheap flight to leave tomorrow morning and I got super excited packed all my stuff and booked it... Then suffered a terrible panic attack and now just feel really sad and thinking I've set myself up for failure again as I cant go. I know it's probably just the startup effects of sertraline but my moods are swinging so much I can't settle on a decision to go or not. Then that justs leads me to believe I should stay at home and continue adjusting to the drug and keeping active and healthy for this week off work. Thoughts????

I'm a freshman in highschool and since the start of school I've pretty much hanged out with these 6 people. 4 girls, 2 guys. I'm a guy btw. The only reason I'm friends with them, since I doubt they would've accepted me otherwise, is because of my elementary school friend, Grant. Grant can be an asshole sometimes, noone really bats an eye. The second I make an inappropriate comment or something they all tell me I'm an idiot or a giant asshole. Sometimes they threaten to kick me out of our circle. Oh no, everyone else gets a pass, not you though. Of course, I can be a dick, but at least I'm not a hypocrite. I feel so stressed out being friends with them, like I'm walking on eggshells, always trying to be on my best behavior. But my best ain't good enough. Our town has a festival every year, and I looked all over for them and genuinely tried to get with them. They barely told me where they were going/doing. Really helped me. I ended up with an eighth grader buddy of mine looking for them. We went down to the fire station where his dad works, since it was raining heavily at the time. Well guess who showed up? One of the girl's, Lauren, her dad is a fireman too. So grant, Lauren, and my other friends conveniently show up there. I was so pissed off, sad, and ashamed, when I should've been happy. I ran off shortly after(yes, they knew I was there). They didn't even ask for me to come back. Of course, it's not always shitty times like that. I have fun with them. If I didn't I wouldn't think twice about leaving them. And they're about the only close friends I have. Although, fuck them, I haven't done a single thing with friends since school started. They never invite me to do anything with them. I feel like if I left, they're lives wouldn't be as fun, but they wouldn't care at the same time. I'm just feeling real neglected, you know? I feel like they would be mad at me if I told them this. I can't lose these people, but we all need to be a lot better. Please help.",

        "query": "When you can only see yourself as a complication When faced with an irreversible neurological condition, few options are available for easing the difficulties. Regardless of what our community, school system, and media have tried to encourage, or establish, deep down we all know we'd only truly accept conformity. Those who are unmistakably different, are gathered into a group and tossed into a room decorated to suit the one assumed mental state of only childlike thoughts and feelings. Whatever their genetics decided to switch up on them, the result becomes their identity, their medical condition, their personality trait. Nothing they can communicate and no action they can execute, is believed to have value. This was the reality of my life when I was young, prior to extensive attempted correction. Sure, I've learned to minimize the visibility of my affliction, but the problem is, I know it's there. Humans naturally decide to only like who they select; it's impossible to appreciate the entirety of our population. Whenever someone seems indifferent towards me I anxiously concur, “Oh, it must be my Aspergers. They can tell.” It leaves me questioning any interaction, any decision I make. I can't live without the uncertainty that everything I do is wrong. Aspergers has prevented me from living a limitless life and I wish to free myself from its oppression. I want more than anything to remove Asperger's control over my brain. I want more than anything to surmise I am a pleasant person to be around. I want more than anything to be unapologetic for simply speaking up. I want more than anything to be determined the child my parents are proud of. The craziest, upsetting thing is, this is a basic function others are born with, these are things I need. I'm tired of being called “r******” by my sister, I'm tired of being told I “Look special needs,” by my Mother, I'm tired of overhearing “You didn't discipline her enough” from my Grandma, and the one day I won't be metaphorically tired, like most people, is the day I die, and enter an eternal sleep. Or as others suggests, heaven, the place where we roam in our perfect forms. I personally can't even fathom my ideal self, since I don't know who I am without the burdening presence of my supposed defect. In my early years, I was a sensitive subject. A baby that resembled my mother finally, briefly I was flawless, visited by relatives just so I could receive their various praises. Leah my older sister imagined me as her playmate, not as my caregiver. Eventually my charm became constant crying, eyes that could never smile, and stunted social development. As soon as she could, my Mother tried to have me diagnosed. I was too young for them to actually confirm something. She remained persistent in identifying the problem. Books were purchased, listing traits that made her sigh with relief when recognized. She said I had Asperger's as a resort for anyone questioning my mannerisms. Quickly I picked up this habit too, hoping it to be an excuse that spared me from societal rejection. Following my coming to terms with the assumption my Mother made, I experienced many limitations. Asperger's kept me from being in my correct grade. I wasn't able to develop a true connection with anyone outside of my immediate family. The only sibling I have thinks of me more of a chore and a fragile object about to damage her reputation, than a friend. Constantly I feel lonely, even when I obviously should not. Though I have a sufficient intellect, my struggle to communicate confidently and clearly, and process directions, makes me susceptible to being looked down on. I'll never forget being called mentally slow by a friend, in front of his Dad. People easily can turn against me. Asperger's is a wall between my motives and my communication. Rarely do I have bad intentions, and rarely do I tune people out. Asperger's has made me out to be a worse person than I want to be perceived. My Mom is certain she's close to a cure for me, she just hasn't put me in enough therapy. Over a course of many years, professionals studied me. One place would literally strap wires to my cranium, and as I was dubious of any progress, my Mother was consumed by the placebo effect. One piece of advice I'v",

The other four crowns would have been a total of around $1200 with insurance. I told the dentist I lost my job and was unable to pay.

She said that crowns were 'out of the question now since I lost my job and don't have stable work' whilst rolling her eyes at me. I never went back to the dentist after that and my teeth look fucking gross.

I've gotten closer to new friends, mostly my gym buddy, who I hung out with outside of the gym for the first time.

I literally made an ENTIRE new group of friends since you've been gone. I've had plans every weekend since you've been gone. I've sought out a therapist to work on my low self-esteem. I started reading a self-help dating book recommended to me by friends. I booked a flight on a complete whim to visit my former best friend for her birthday in two weeks.

Seroquel: can we say T I R E D &amp; groggy as absolute hell? i could NOT function. Abilify: oh, god the nausea. I threw up for 2 days straight, thought i had the flu, turned out to be abilify. Saphris: God i loved saphris...while it worked. :( Lamictal: this gave me some weird ass symptoms, including a pretty bad rash. Xanax: for anxiety, I realized i was showing signs of addiction, so i quit. ** My new pdoc (the one i'm going back to) tried experimenting with some ant-seizure meds for awhile, i can't remember what they were called, but one of them gave me \"cold like symptoms\". i thought i was sick, i read the label and it legit said that it causes similar symptoms, so i stopped taking that cause wtf? they also didn't do diddly-squat. Oxcarbazepine: Also an anti seizure med??? Was this a new thing or..?? Anyways, these were the ones i remember, it was like a 2-3 year journey, and i don't remember the rest of them very well :/ but those were the ones i think i tried the longest or had the weirdest symptoms idk. So here's the question that's probably been asked a million times; sorry if it has: Basically, what are everyone's experiences on Lithium? I've been reading a lot and people have talked a lot about Lithium for Bipolar. I've done some research, read lots of studies and what not, but i want to know some personal experiences. I've heard wonderful things &amp; terrifying things. i've kinda hit such a low point with this illness that i know my brain needs a little help &amp; my symptoms have only gotten worse like the paranoia, and psychosis, stuff like that. I'm kinda ready to do almost anything. but yeah, sorry this is so long. yikes. Is it as terrible as i'm reading about? with the kidney problems and stuff or is it more or less a safe thing as long as you keep up with the blood tests, staying hydrated, etc? I mean, i already drink a crazy amount of water a day, so staying hydrated shouldn't be a problem for me, lol. Anyways, this is full of rambling. i'm sorry. thank you in advance and hope every one has a great day! :)",
        "response": "bipolar disorder. Reasoning: The post mentions a history of being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and describes trying multiple medications for the condition, including antiseizure medications. The individual expresses interest in trying lithium and asks for personal experiences with the medication. This suggests that the person is seeking information and potential treatment options specifically related to their bipolar disorder.",

She got me a prescription the same day and complimented me on having done all my research beforehand, saying that was part of her decision to medicate me now instead of doing a full mental health appointment later AND switched around my appt later this month so she's the one doing my first OBGYN instead of a practicum doctor.

I thought I had accommodation until mid December but the apartment I was in is being demolished and I was told last week that I had to leave on Monday. Thanks to the kindness of a stranger here I was able to afford train travel to a nearby town and accommodation for one night but now I just don't know what to do.

I refused to pay her bills anymore. I refused to let her live in my home because she vomits in sinks and calls me horrible names. I don't need that around my young son. I'm a single mom, I have enough to contend with without her. When she would get drunk she'd text me angry messages about how I should pray she was alive in the morning. Alluded to it being my fault. She actually named me in two suicide notes, failing in the attempts but leaving me mentally scarred from the words she wrote and wanted me to live with when she was gone. Now she's sober. Two months, good for her 👏 👏 👏. I had cut her out of my life since last June. It calmed down my life. It made everything quieter.

She blamed me for her house burning down 3 years ago. I didn't even live there. She then blamed me for her not being able to pay her rent. She cussed me and berated me on a phone I paid for, for her, about how I never helped her. I could give you all the violence and crying and watching her nod out. I could tell you about having to call 911 and watch my little brothers cry in fear on multiple occasions because she ended up in the ICU and then the mental hospital. I could list the names she's called me and the tears I've cried. Just to give you an idea. But I guess it isn't worth it. I don't want to deal with her anymore.

I'm so scared of disappointing them, but I feel like I'm gonna fail college no matter what, because I just can't stand computer sciences, I'm sorry but I've always despised it no matter what.

The depression, I know it never really goes away but the black cloud I experienced 3 years ago was really hard. I never had any self harming thoughts so I'm gonna stop y'all right there. I don't want to hurt myself. I love my life, recently married, sharing a home with my husband and our pets, I have so much to be grateful for. And I am. I'm so grateful for all the good things in my life and I try hard to focus on that. I have a journal that I write in frequently listing the things I'm grateful for that day. I meditate, well when I remember to. I practice and teach yoga. I love it, it's helped me in more ways than I can count. I try to eat right, I know I don't drink enough water but I try to. I literally am trying everything I can to take care of myself. When I went through that black cloud experience I was prescribed anti-depressants. *if you have them and you use them and they help you that's great, I am not judging.* but my experience was not like that. I felt numb. I felt empty and grey and the crying stopped but I was snarky and crabby and irritable. I don't know how my then fiancée (now husband) loved me through that. We didn't have sex. It was worse than being depressed to me. At least the depression I felt something. Even though it sucked. I hope I'm overthinking. I hope this is just a rough week and that I'll snap out of it. I know it's now how it works. But I still hope. Ever since this experience my views on doctors has changed...I went to my doctor and wanted to get off of my anti depressants and he was really pushy. Rude and just prescribed me more. He didn't even listen to how I felt on this medication? Like it didn't matter. So I weaned myself off. I know it could've gone bad but it didn't for me. I eventually pulled myself out of the pit I was in somehow and life eventually just kept getting better. I now self medicate with pot. Which I was very much against for a few years but a big event happened and my husband and I decided to smoke again. That has been more helpful to me than any medication I've tried. It honestly helps me so much. But I don't want to smoke all the time. I know there's a stigma attached to pot. We've been out for awhile and maybe that's my problem.

I had my first real depression at 16 begining sophmore year. I absolutely hated public school and couldnt take it anymore. I would have rather died or take whatever consequence over going. But my parents supported me, got me counseling as soon as they could and got me into a ged program for school which was the best way for me to learn and i ended up graduating with my ged that same year. My depression was completely gone at this point, and 4 months later my parents want to move 20 minutes away to the town my dads resturant is to be closer to work, which is a small ass town with only about 7k people in it and hardly anything that isnt a bar or resturant or bank. I was pretty excited for the move at first, as i could walk to and work at my dads resturant almost everyday and just general excitement about moving into a new and better house. But it ended up being the worst thing to happen to me, i didnt realize how miserable this town would be for a 17-18 year old with no license and no friends. I worked at my dads resturant around 20 hours a week for about half a year after moving, and for the first couple months i saved most of it but after, i spent every single dollar earned on weed. I had literally nothing else to spend it on that wasent food, bowling, or clothes and the closest thing i could save for was getting my license which was 6 months away. I moved 35 minutes away from the town closest to where i previously lived and where all of my friends and school was, and none of them having a license and a car at the time. Ive been here for over a year now and STILL havent made any friends that arent a coworker (they arent very fond of me. I couldnt get yo know them outside of work) despite alot of effort. There was nothing else to do but work, come home, smoke and play games. At first i was fine with it, but as those first six months went by it got really stale and i started to fall into depression again. I worked less and less, when i had weed working felt pointless because its just weed money and i would rather just stay home and smoke. But then when i ran out, i would actually go most days im supposed to but it would still felt pointless because i would have to work but wouldnt get paid untill the friday of the next week and work just to come home after and have literally nothing to do but play the same games. And then just spend what i earn on weed again anyway. Eventually, i stopped working completely. So because i made 0 actual friends in this town , i still couldnt get my license because i never got to do drivers ed, and still none of my friends owned a car and a license all i could do was sit home. Almost all day everday. Everyday felt worse and worse. I got to a point where i would do something i never imagined i could ever do, but i didnt care anymore, whatever would help me feel better or just numb me i will take. Ive stolen over 500$ worth of money and things and countless amount of alcohol from my parents, which they expect me to eventually pay all back. I feel obligated to.... Ive lost all motivation. Entirely. I never shower anymore, never take care of myself, dont eat a third of what a average person should be eating. My life is going to be straight suffering in this place untill i move out or am kicked out. But i have 0 intrest in going back to work or just living as a human being as long as i live here, and if i did i would still have to pay back the money i stole. I turned 18 last month and just got caught stealing another 120 from my parents last week, they already told me i was on thin ice with me stealing from them , theres almost no way its not the last straw. They already told me i have to pay rent once im 18 but havent made me yet. Its only a matter of time before im kicked out, i have no place to go, no experience,no motivation, no will to live.

I think most people are jumping on board a fad instead of working on relationship problems, and don't know what they're signing up for. Look, I get it, I've been in and out of open relationships. It works for some people, and with one of my partners, it was a pretty good deal for both of us. But I found out that it's ultimately not an arrangement I want or am happy with. I live in rural state where these types of relationships were unheard-of ten years ago. Now, they seem to have exploded in popularity overnight. While some people can make it work, in my experience, the vast majority of people are signing the death warrants for their own relationships. And it's not just my own experience—in my own circle of friends, this was quite popular for a while. It would work out—at first. And then, inevitably, one partner would fall for a person they were “just fooling around with,” and they would leave their primary partner for their secondary. It happened, without fail, to each and every one of them. What bugs me is that now dating websites are filled with people who are looking for someone to come be a part of whatever open arrangement they have with their SO. They won't always disclose this on their profile, and after we match, they'll explain what's going on and ask, “So, that cool?” The kicker is how defensive they get when I tell them I've been in those before, and would not want to do it again. They demand details, and declare THEY will make it work out. Sure you will. But if you're so certain, why are you getting this defensive?",

But the contrast between how others perceive me and how I perceive myself is a constant knife in my chest. From the outside looking in, my life is excellent. I have parents who love me, a well-paying job in the same field as my degree, and I'm generally well regarded. I'm smarter than some, and what I lack in that department I try to make up for by being diligent and persistent. I study my profession for pleasure, hit the gym, and try very, very hard to listen and learn from everyone I meet. But my career, money, all of those things are means to an end. Ultimately what I desire most in life is to understand others and to be understood in turn, which is why It's so eternally frustrating that I run the same circle in my social life. I am different. That isn't a label I chose, but it's been put on me by so many disparate groups of people that I've come to accept it. Having jumped between multiple social groups for various reasons, I always start from a different point but end in the same place. I'm liked, included in things, and never make enemies because life is far too short to waste on disliking people. People I don't know well tend to confide in me, and I'm never sure how I earn that honor. But I always end up as a token character, known to be endearing but awkward. I'm the butt of jokes that are well meaning, but often hit too close to my heart to join in on. More than anything I'm not taken seriously, and my goodwill is treated as a given (because by and large it is). The more honest I am with people, the stranger they find me. I have to keep relationships superficial just to keep the status quo, and it kills me inside when others express themselves to me so easily but I find it impossible to do the same with them. I'm sorry this got so long. I don't even know what anyone could say that would change how I feel, because I truly do like myself, where I'm at in life, and I don't really want to change.

        "query": "Online Dating drains everything from you Not at all an original thread, but I need to get this out somewhere. Online dating is the fucking worst. I'm a 24 y/o Asian male living in a major American city, working full time, and given my schedule, don't really have the option to go out and meet people frequently. I'm also fairly introverted, although most of my friends and the people I meet don't think that because I usually do a good job of not seeming that way. I don't think anything I can post here won't have been posted before. I've tried several major apps (Tinder, Bumble, CMB) and the results are basically the same. I swipe on a bunch of girls, get very few matches. Of the matches I get, only a few respond to any message I send, and I tailor all my messages based on profiles. Of the responses I get, only a few send a second response, or responses longer than a single word. OF THOSE responses, I only get a few numbers, and from numbers, only a few respond then. I set up dates, and only a few bother to go through with it. Two have \"gotten sick\", one rescheduled 3 times, each time proposing a different day with a different excuse, and several have just straight up ghosted. The result is something like a funnel that narrows into a dropper. It doesn't help that for awhile, I swiped right on *EVERYONE* just to see whether or not my race made a difference, like some people told me it would before I started. It does. Of the last 100 matches I got, 83 were East Asians. This doesn't really matter to me, since this isn't something I care about in a partner, but it doesn't help to know that from the get go there is a vast segment of the population that will likely discount you based on something out of your control. It's fucking tiring, and moreso than that, it fucking sucks that there's no one I can vent about this to. I run with a fairly liberal crowd, which is expected given my age group and location, but any criticism of women on dating apps leads straight to accusations of \"you're not entitled to women\", or \"you need to prove that you can offer them something\", or \"don't be creepy\", or something along those lines. For context, I'm making a six figure salary, go to the gym regularly, and still play the sport that I competed at a national level at in high school and college. Every message I send is tailored to the girl I'm sending it to, I dress well compared to a lot of people I know, and while I wouldn't consider myself attractive, I wouldn't say I'm ugly either. I'm also 6', probably 6' 1\" with shoes on. I realize the above sounds like arrogance, but I'm really at the point where I wonder how much more I need to bring to the table before I'm worth someone else's time of day. Constantly hearing that I'm entitled because I want a girl to either put in any effort or just *RESPOND* is really starting to get to me, and all through it I just have to grit my teeth, suck it up, and accept that sometimes things are unfair and you have to play through. Honestly, it could just be bad luck. It could be me, it could be that I just need to be more attractive, more fit, more wealthy, have a better personality, all of that. Rejection via online dating isn't going to stop me from pursuing all of that. And yes, I realize girls can be busy. I realize that many get so much attention on dating apps, there's no incentive for them to give a shit about me. It makes sense from a purely logical standpoint. Yes, some guys are creepy as shit, and yes, I'm not entitled to their attention. I've heard all of this. I just want to be treated like a person, and I'm tired of being treated like a misogynistic animal for wanting that. I'm tired of people acting like women can do no wrong in dating, and that any criticism levied at them in the process is misogyny. I'm just really tired of it all.",

So, i notice when its that time of the month or whatever (i've pretty much always noticed this), My moods get a bit dangerous. i'll be mostly stable the rest of the month but since i'm already a sensitive person when i'm on my period, i feel like my moods go to the extremes, really quick. right now, i keep having random extremely angry thoughts. i don't have anything to be mad about. but i just feel almost uncontrollably angry. its like literally my brain goes to polar opposites and its frustrating.

In fact I'm really learning that ADHD, or a wandering mind, is the foundation for many of the psychiatric disorders. I can't and won't take ADHD meds because I get addicted to them and go manic but I'm learning to pay attention through self-discipline, which is what the book is all about, \"paying attention, on purpose, as if your life depended on it.\" I know mindfulness works because it was taught bare bones in Star Wars and, when I was a child, I would pretend to be Jedi's in the backyard with my brother and would teach him to be \"mindful of the present moment,\" as I believe Qui-Gon said. It's not a solution to deep-rooted anxiety issues, or issues that should be medicated, but if you're being counseled and are on meds, mindfulness is a good tool in the toolbox to have.

After a very shitty year where I lost our house to foreclosure, our savings, and nearly did in my loving family (wife and two daughters, 13 and 10), I've been diagnosed as bipolar. The psychiatrist has me on a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant for now, which seem to be helping. They're still making a full assessment so we've got a ways to go as yet. My wife has been amazing — despite the shock of the foreclosure and all the monetary problems she's stayed with me and helped me find well recommended doctors and therapists for help. We've been going through couples counseling as well to help us get on the same page — the couples counselor suggested I might be bipolar, which started us working through the diagnosis process and into treatment. My kids haven't been told of the diagnosis yet, and we're not sure if or when we will tell them, or how. Personally, I'm a little freaked out. I've already been diagnosed as ADD, which seems to also be correct, but that seems a lesser issue since I am able to hyper focus and accomplish a lot. Or maybe that was a combination of hyper focus and manic episodes. I'm having trouble coming to terms with who's right now. It's been a hard blow, and has fractured my self image. I've always considered myself in control of my mind and actions and now I really don't know what I'm in control of any more. It's been surreal and I've been feeling a little lost.

My girlfriend's very supportive, but she doesn't really believe Bipolar Disorder is even a thing (she's really New-Age). And she blames all my bad moods on herself, which just makes me feel worse. None of my friends know. And they're probably too stressed over a calc final or whatever to care much right now.

Im so incredibly anxious about the baby that it's hard to breathe. I'm anxious about EVERYTHING: autism, a chromosomal disorder, sometimes (including now) I convince myself that she has a mild form of downs, SIDS, I'm scared that she's gonna be too cold and freeze or that she's gonna be too hot and increase the chance of SIDS, a few minutes ago her pacifier was against her nose and now I'm scared that she's going to suffocate because we aren't watching 100% of the time. I'm anxious about her breathing when it's audible and then I'm anxious that she's not breathing when I can't hear it.

One of the main triggers was because a guy I'd been seeing had been acting distant with me, cancelling plans etc. Whenever he cancelled a plan, didn't reply to a text or said something unhelpful to me, my immediate reaction was to panic, cry, feel frightened, feel unloved. It was such an overwhelming feeling I couldn't focus on my job or my chores etc. Sometimes I'd even call him up in a state of panic or manipulate his emotions to try and get some attention. I just needed to do something that would relax my state of mind and put me back into a secure and loved state again. But then I decided to start meditating and watched some therapy videos on YouTube. They put me at ease and taught me that my problem isn't that he's not interested in me or that he doesn't love me; my problem is my own thoughts. I am never going to be able to feel his love for me because his love his HIS feeling only. I can only feel the love I give out. I know this now and this knowledge has put me at ease. But still, knowing this doesn't stop my immediate reaction to stressful events. I know in the future if I'm with someone and they reject me in some form, I am going to feel panicky and upset again, regardless of the therapy and mindfulness I teach myself. I know its natural to feel this way, but I do feel I become more erratic than is normal. So my question is, how do I stop having these overly emotional outbursts and panic attacks? Is it even possible? I don't want to be so overwhelmed and stressed whenever I feel like someone is going off me or doesn't love me anymore. I don't want to be codependent and fear relationships just because I'm afraid of getting hurt. At the end of the day, I can only hurt myself.

I think of how the universe existed before me and I never minded till I was born. I think of my being a part of the cosmos beginning to understand itself. I think of some kind of after life. Nothing helps too much. It's such a mystery that now, months after I've tried to improve, I sometimes feel like it's never going to stop. I can't ever know what comes after, if anything, so that fear's always going to be there. I sometimes feel that there may be no point in trying to distract myself from the inevitability of it. It's not the most upbeat update I guess, if anything it's kinda downer. That may be because I'm on a bad day or something I guess. Or maybe that's just how I'm doing. I'd love to get some responses and thoughts, see what you guys think.",

        "query": "Anxiety has ruined my life, but I have hope I can rebuild it. (Possible Trigger Warning) *I usually word things pretty well, but I'm venting so forgive me if some things sound weird.* I haven't had an easy life. I'm not saying this to gain any sympathy, rather as a part of the point I'm making. I have watched my older brother go from a happy kid to a domestic abusive, violent drug dealer who has been in jail more times than I can count. My grandmother, whom I was very close to all of my life has severe Alzheimer's disease and cannot remember who I am, only that I look like her husband used to. My father left me when I was about 13 years old after becoming an alcoholic, and now doesn't even bother to message me on facebook on my birthday. My little brother seems to be going down the same path as my older brother, though he may get his head straight soon enough. To top everything off my mother is on welfare and dying from something the doctors still haven't figured out. None of those things ever stopped me from living. Those things are heartbreaking and awful, but they were just things that I had to love with, and I did. I did really well in school, and as of now I'm the only one in my family to finish high school. Last summer my older brother attempted suicide in-front of me. (I won't go into detail because I do not intend to trigger an episode for anyone here) This ‘event' really messed me up, mainly because I didn't feel any emotion at the time. I feel bad that I didn't feel bad. I stay up at night wondering if I was just traumatized by the whole thing, or if I actually lost all sympathy for my older brother. I later started having episodes of nausea and digestive issues. Nothing major like puking or diarrhea, but just unable to function properly. My mother thought I started developing Chron's disease (If I spelled that right) because a few of my family members have it. I wasn't able to eat for days at a time, and sometimes weeks would go by where I would eat nothing but a piece of bread. I couldn't go to school without shaking and feeling like something horrible was going to happen. Everything around me was fine, but I was living in hell. We went to the hospital many times to have my blood tested, have x-rays done, and other tests that all came back negative for a possible cause. My doctor then considered that what I had could be some kind of anxiety disorder. At the time I didn't understand because I had no idea anxiety could affect your body, but after him assigning me therapy and a mild medication I learned that was indeed what I had. Even though the medication helps a lot, as everyone here probably knows, it can never completely shut it down. This has been a problem I have lived with for only about a year and a half, but it has beaten me to my breaking point. Though I did well in school and got accepted to college, I didn't go. I could barely muster the strength to walk through my high school's doors for my senior year, living away from home for four years in an unknown environment sounded impossible. I am currently a few days away from my 19th birthday and at the lowest low of my life. I am unemployed, anti-social, depressed, and not even hanging out with my friends much anymore even though they want me to. Not to mention a crippling anxiety disorder that I deal with, albeit with medication to keep it at pay most days. All those things in my life I could live with as life had never been easy, but anxiety has truly defeated me. Anxiety has defeated me and it will most likely defeat me many times more. However many times it needs to defeat me until I finally win, I will be ready. Usually I'd say something like “I've been through worse” but I really haven't. However, I will never lose hope, and I will never give up. I look forward to the day I take my life back.",

So, after an exceptionally bad month and a half of panic and anxiety attacks, them being so bad I wasn't able to eat, socialize, or leave my home, I wound up in the emergency room. I felt totally scared, anxious, and hopeless. They prescribed me an anti-depressant. I was totally not down, incredibly nervous to resort to meds, after all the bad stuff I read online. But the anxiety was so bad that I kind of felt like I had no choice. I took my first pill (escitalopram) on January 1st. The first 2 weeks or so sucked. My anxiety was a little higher, I was sweaty as hell, and my head kind of hurt. But on 5mg I was feeling a little less anxious after 2 weeks or so. I then had a bit of a relapse, had some anxiety, and though I was once again nervous, I upped my dosage to 10mg. I had a bad headache most of 3 days, and then it went away. So where am I now? I'm mostly anxiety free. I still feel somewhat on edge sometimes, but it's nowhere near as bad as before. I used to have dreams and nightmares every night, and wake up in a panic, unable to calm my mind. My mornings are totally fine now. Today, I cleaned my apartment, something which I wasn't able to do before. I feel like my energy and motivation levels are up as well. The only negative side-effecst I have is a decreased libido, it's difficult to achieve orgasm, and a little more tired than normal, but it's a price I'll pay to feel better in my head. I'm also seeing a talk therapist, and started CBT therapy. I'm a little nervous about coming off the meds when the time comes, but hopefully the CBT will prepare me to deal with everything when the time comes. I've chosen to write this to give other people some positive feedback about medication, for once. Everything on the internet is so vile and so bad for you. Sure, being on meds isn't ideal, but it's better than where I was a month and a half ago. I know everyone is different and reacts to medication differently, but I really urge anyone whose really struggling to at least see their doctor or a mental health specialist. Medication is not evil. It's just a tool to help you get some relief from symptoms while you work out the underlying cause of your anxiety with a therapist. Also, just because it needs to be said, I'm not really interested in your negative beliefs about medication. All those negative stereotypes and stigmas really did me tons of harm when I was at my worst, and though medication might not be for some, it's worked for me.

Causing serious insomnia, and has tripled my anxiety! Nixing that! The problem is, it's doubling my anxiety! I didn't even see that on the side effect list? Also, it's supposed to be a groggy med taken at night, but no! Not me! I'm now taking it in the morning and still wake up way early. My options left, are rexulti, vraylar, or ECT. I don't know if I should continue to wait an entire damned month just to see if it'll end up working with this amount of anxiety. I DO know ECT is miraculous for me, but have no one to get me there and back 3x a week. Sorry just rambling in every direction, just realized that. I can NOT deal with my messy apt! It's increasing my depression so much more. Like, a month worth of laundry in a tiny 500 sq ft apt. I need someone to push me to do it. I got used to that before having to cut my toxic egg donor out of my life. I know if I could just get my apt really clean it would help immensely. I'm even prescribed adderall and STILL no motivation. Can't laugh at my favorite show, I love Lucy. Was really hard to type all this out so please be gentle and no criticism PLEASE. Is anyone on rexulti or vraylar that is not gaining weight and is getting good results? To *that* person...I know meds work differently for everyone and I need to speak with pdoc about med changes 😂 I'm just trying to garner others' experiences, I won't take it as medical advice. Ha! I'm seriously so close to the hospital, but cannot, not, not put my baby (doggie) in boarding again! They screwed her up so bad last time! Anyone want to be a laundry bud? 😂 I dunno if I'm joking or not. Sigh. All I do is look at the wall half the freaking day. As far as meditation, mindfulness, I'm a half-ass practicing Buddhist so that is all covered, but it doesn't fix the chemicals. It IS most likely keeping me out of the hospital, though.",

I've literally made so many mistakes some of which were my own but many of which were forced by my fucking parents. When I️ was born mom and dad you had money and then your family fucked y'all over and we went broke. Not a dollar to our fucking name. We moved from California to Virginia because that's the only place we could live. I️ remember everything all the stress that I‎t put you through. Shit I️ even remember when I️ was 4 we couldn't even afford to buy milk or some food. So you bought milk for me and my brothers. I️ was 4 1/2 and I‎t was the first time I️ heard my dad say fuck. We moved to Virginia and some of my moms second cousins took us in. I‎t was 9 people In a two bedroom house while my dad worked his ass off to rebuild himself from what his brother did to him. We finally moved out 2 years later into our own apartment. We were 5 people living in a 1 bedroom apartment. Me and my brothers slept on the floor in the same room as y'all. Everything was fine though because we still had food a roof over our head and food. My dad worked his fucking ass off! mom. He did his best but almost every other fucking day you would argue with him about what my dads brother did to him. And how he shouldn't have done this that etc. They never got over I‎t and from an early age all I️ ever experienced was extreme stress from I‎t. Literally every night I went to bed and questioned and asked God why this happened. Now I️ don't believe in God. How could I️ be so dumb to believe there's an imaginaire deity in the sky. It's fucking stupid and honestly if he was actually real I️ would spit on IT because it's the most disrespectful thing I️ can think of doing. How the fuck can you cause not only me but so many other people so much pain you fucking Bitch. Anyway let me stop side tracking. My parents finally started making good money you know. I️ mean a lot. I'm 2010 they made about $800,000 between the two of them. And between a 2006-2012 probably made about 2-3 million dollars. But you fucking idiots you never saved any fucking money. Never my mom is a greedy ass bitch. For a few years in a row during that time span she would go out everyday fucking day with her friend and spend a significant amount of money probably averaged to 500$ a day everyday for 2-3 years. On top of that she would love to go on vacations and claimed I‎t was for us and for future memories etc. You know I'm not ungrateful at all for you taking us but I️ am extremely disappointed that you say you did I‎t for us. I️ would always say we're not saving any money and mom is fucking dumb you can't reason with her. You'll go spend a 1,000 and you'll come home and say she only spend a couple hundred. Even after you we prove I‎t to you with the receipt as evidence. You know I️ can't tell you what to do with your money it's yours even though you were supposed to provide for us. Which you did but you made I‎t seem like we were a punishment. Dad I️ love you but I️ wish you stood up to that bitch and told her to fucking relax and be more humble and down to earth. My mom loves to show off her image is everything to her. I️ wish you had saved money because for the past 5 years since I️ turned about 18 we've been broke. The amount of strsss that I've always been under is too much. I️ tried to go pro in tennis and I️ was so good but mentally I️ could never get there because of the fear to fail. I️ went to university of Virginia and I️ got fucked when I️ signed an expensive lease to house that I️ could barely afford but I️ wanted that college experience and to get away from mom after community college that I️ didn't even check the place out.

For those of you who do not know, I was sexually abused for years growing up. Sarah, I'm sorry I lied to you about it; it seemed the right thing to do at the time. This abuse caused problems in my marriage with Amy. I sought out other women and had inappropriate ideas toward sex and intimacy. I viewed material that should not be viewed, not for pleasure but to see if I could understand why someone would do that to a child like they had done to me. I thankfully could not understand it.* *Amy, I talked to other women but did not ever have any physical contact or exchanges beyond talking. I'm sorry for destroying your trust in me. I struggled for years to rebuild that trust and regain your love. I was honestly okay with the divorce when it happened. It made sense.* *But you betrayed me and everyone we know. You are a terrible person for what you have done. You told me of your crush on Rob before we ever married band I thought nothing of it. You facilitated Rob's divorce. Then you made sure to be there for him during it. As soon as it was finalized you initiated our own so you could be with him. You lied to our entire family about it, people who love you with all their hearts. You do not deserve to have such great people in your life. Without leaving any doubt, this is the slimiest thing I have ever witnessed a human being do. I am ashamed that I ever loved you and sad that Charlotte will continue to be your daughter.

My trust in people is completely broken.* *Landon and Eli, I'm sorry that I can not be stronger for you. I miss you both. I've honestly only made it this far through the strength you have given me. You are my brothers. I love you. It is my last wish that the money I have saved be given to you for the house.* *Charlotte, I know you're too young to understand.

No boyfriend and very little hope of actually finding the right guy. I've been through as deep depression of unending death thoughts and ways to make it happen. This is how my best friend got my position. She would make me go out and do fun things. She'd come over and pick me up even when I didn't want to go. Now the feelings are back and stronger than ever. I often have thoughts of getting a gun and doing the deed. If someone handed me one I know I'd take the opportunity and do it with little thought. I don't ever want to hurt my family and friends though. Lately my best friend has changed and turned into a selfish person showing little consideration of others. It feels like we shouldn't be friends anymore but she is also my only friend. Losing a friend is like losing a reason to keep going. I am on meds and have seen a therapist in the past. I just don't want to get myself out there to find another therapist (the one I had retired). I need help. I don't know what kind but I just need help. I don't want to scar those around me...",

After realizing I wasn't going to get back to sleep, I checked the time: 530 am. I guess I'll go get breakfast. Straight to McDonald's, tried to get a large fry and a sausage mcmuffin with egg, but they weren't keen on fries; I chose 2 sausage burritos instead. I called in to my phone to check the times on my favorite coffee place: open at 5am. I drive about 20 minutes there and back, tasting great as always. Good flavor, something to soak in. I get back home, games for a bit and head in to work early. Work's boring, but I got out at a reasonable time. I'm distracted by mental arguments I'm having with the impressions of people in my head. Friends, family, others. I called home on break and had a good conversation with family for a bit, and expressed that I don't think what I'm taking is working. After finishing up, I head to the dispensary, pick up some flower and then home. On arrival I charge my phone and fall asleep on the couch from exhaustion for a few hours, waking up from a nightmare. I roll off the couch and find a text for a message about hanging out tomorrow and my mood is lifted. I try to relay my day the negative things in my day in a positive manner, but I feel it comes off as selfish. They have their own problems, why am I bothering them with mine? Shouldn't I have asked about them more? I put down the phone and head outside to smoke. I hadn't had a prerolled in a bit, so I wasn't ready for the heat in my face and mouth. I finish up and go back inside, starting to feel good already. I get back to room and sit down, letting the feeling wash over me. It swept up and down, pulsing through. It was a good high. I think about how good this feels and wonder if the dreams are a result of the exhaustion and related to my mind having a lot built up being awake so long. I consider that we need sleep to help our muscles relax better so our body can do its work. Including our brain, especially so. And the amount of exhaustion and chemicals related to the types of thoughts through the day may directly relate to the dreams we have; namely, the nightmare I woke from. I start to smile and take comfort in this and say something positive. I feel the happiness in what I said and can tell I'm feeling better. I realize how much my demeanor had changed in that short time span. I think about how I don't like my smile, it makes my face look fat and ridiculous. I look better without smiling that big. I wonder if I'm more attractive when I'm depressed, since I'm smiling less. I consider if I'm remaining depressed to be more attractive for attention due to my insecurities. I'm down to sad at this point. I consider how selfish my insecurities may look to others and imagine explaining to them: I'm sorry, I just want to want to look attractive to find a mate so I can feel love. I just want to feel love. I'm crying. I inhale deeply and decide that wasn't fun, but note I was able to stop it before it became too bad and blithering in to further despair. I lay down on my bed and note the repeated fluctuations in my mood and ability to analyze what happened for a few minutes. This process of self analysis followed by negative thoughts with reduction to tears repeats for a few more cycles. I get up and hop on my computer for a bit to play some video games and listen to some music. I'm channeling the emotion of relating deeply with the lyrics that hit home, while the others fall flat.

I don't talk unless it's seeking advice or whining about myself and my problems.

This isnt because I feel under pressure it's just even if I had all the time in the world I can't come up with anything good. And that goes even for jokes or flirting or anything. I have no wit.

I increase that to 1/3 in the winter. It helps significantly. 2. I go to a tanning booth every 10 to 12 days. Sunshine comes with vitamin D. This is replacement therapy. 3. I give my ever changing negative thoughts names; highly critical Carl, low energy Filbert, you fucked everything up Harvey, people are right to judge you Dexter. I try and name the highly negative emotions I feel so I can put them outside of myself and name them. I say to myself and to these characters that you are not me. I will not FORGET YOU. You are part of me and I promise to listen to you but you are not in control here. I am. 4. I force myself to EAT GOOD. This is the hardest because of the low energy but I drag myself to a decent place to eat or go buy some good food and cook it myself. 5. I write a list of things I need to do and prioritize it and TRY to start on at least one. Even if it's a tiny piece of it. I make myself do it. Maybe some of these things will help you, maybe not.

Not down to the point of not being able to get out of bed, but like it's hard for me to do stuff like shower because what's the point, and I constantly feel down. Some days I wish I didn't have a son and partner so I could just die and get it over with. My question in the title is because: - This time last year I had a depressive episode. Anniversary episode? - I'm having a tough time liking my job. This is not getting better any time soon. I've looked for more jobs and the ones I can take I've already applied and been rejected for (so looking at job search engines is REALLY crappy) - Danger is working but we haven't really gotten a full paycheck yet and we are still really food bank poor. (But this is getting better.) - Stress from not being able to pay bills (may be related to previous)(this is getting better soon) - My pdoc took me off of Latuda in August. I don't remember if it helped though. My question is, does it matter why I'm feeling down? Or do we just focus on the fact that I'm feeling down and try to fix that? I take my meds as prescribed and my sleep schedule is good. I try to eat healthy and take my vitamins. Exercise is hard because my thing is walking and now that Danger is working evening/nights I don't feel safe going out in the dark with a toddler. I try to meditate every day. I've been taking CBD oil regularly. Two coffees a day. Etc. What else can I be doing? I'm trying to schedule a 3rd shower (on Fridays), but I've been trying to do that for a while now and it hasn't been happening. I'm tired of being smelly. Danger says \"Then just do it\" and it's not that easy but he doesn't understand. Do light boxes work? Should I invest in a light box? Or would taking vitamin D function the same? I am indoors every day. I've taken Omega 3s off and on throughout the years, sometimes every day for months. Do they **really** help? Should I take on a hobby? I have some time after my son goes to bed at night. I really want to drink again but I know I can't. I also won't do anything that would make me fail a drug test. I go to therapy but right now we're dealing with CPTSD. And our appointments are sporadic (some months twice, some months once, some months not at all) due to our schedules. My pdoc keeps rescheduling me. I was supposed to see her in September but won't see her until December, because of being rescheduled so much. I don't know if I want to contact her because I'm not trying to get on more meds. Sorry, this is probably a lot, thanks for reading. Any advice would be welcome.",
        "response": "bipolar disorder. Reasoning: The post mentions experiencing depressive symptoms, such as difficulty doing daily tasks like showering and feeling down constantly. The individual also mentions having a son and partner but having thoughts of not wanting them so they could die.

The mention of a past depressive episode and the current struggles with liking their job and financial stress may suggest cyclic patterns characteristic of bipolar disorder. Additionally, the individual mentions taking medication for their condition, trying various self-care strategies, and attending therapy, which are common treatment approaches for bipolar disorder.",

        "query": "Donnie Darko, Bipolarity, and Time travel Donnie Darko is one of my favorite films of all time. If you haven't seen it, stop reading this, go watch it. It's on Netflix. Significant spoilers follow. Also: I will be using \"manic\" interchangeably to mean hypomanic or manic, for brevity's sake. Donnie is a dissatisfied, schizophrenic teenager in sleepy Middlesex, Anystate USA. Up until a giant bunny rabbit named Frank warns him that the world is going to end in just over 28 days. This prophecy seems to inspire Donnie into taking actions that, he believes, will save the universe as it should exist, with him at the center of everything that transpires. Until this happens, though, Donnie's disillusionment with the simplistic schemas of life that are presented to him deepen, and his frustration grows. An outlet for this is his English teacher's class. Ms. Pomeroy, the teacher, assigned Graham Greene's \"The Destructors\" to the class to read. In offering his thoughts, Donnie says that, \"Destruction is a form of creation... They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart. They want to change things.\" From being challenged with what is arguably difficult literature, from a thematic point of view, Donnie is subsequently subjected by another teacher, Kitty Farmer, to a self-help guru's model of life, based on two things: Fear and Love. Because, you know, 10 year old boys wet the bed out of fear, but stop because of love. /s When asked to rate a moral dilemma on this incredibly narrow scale, Donnie objects. I think the entire exchange is worth reproducing below: &gt;Donnie: Well, life isn't that simple. I mean, who cares if Ling Ling returns the wallet and keeps the money? It has nothing to do with either fear or love. &gt;Kitty Farmer: Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions. &gt;Donnie: Okay. But you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here, like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You can't just lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else. Woah. Stop the presses. This really hit me hard. I've seen this movie several times, but this is my first time watching it since being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. And this really jumped out at me: **\"You can't just lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else.\"** Early in my diagnosis, and even to a degree now, I tried to identify my bipolarity in everything I could. I'm feeling energetic, am I hypo? I'm feeling sad, am I depressed? I had an impulsive thought! Is that a sign that things are developing? I feel energetic after drinking coffee! Shit, I'm definitely hypo. And on and on. I've also seen this overidentification, this overanalyzing of what can be, and often are, normal human emotions and behaviors on the bipolar subreddits. And that makes sense why we would be so introspective: Bipolar disorder is insidious, and it affects almost every aspect of our lives. But we are not MANIC or DEPRESSED. We are not EUTHYMIC or MANIC. We are not DEPRESSED or EUTHYMIC. It's just not that simple. It's unfair to us individually to ascribe every feeling or thought we have as due to bipolar disorder. It is, in a word, damning, and denies us our right to claim our own feelings and experiences as uniquely ours. The way I think about my mood swings is they're like a funhouse mirror: They take what I normally feel and experience and blow it up, distort it in a hundred different ways. But it's transient. It always is. That's the nature of bipolar disorder. Doesn't it make sense, then, that emotions and feelings and thoughts that we have before an episode, that we may also have in an episode, and after, could just be us, and not influenc",

I was constantly jittery, slept around 3-4 hours a night, and had a lot of anxiety, and self harming issues.
