I show you what individuals are pretending to be, what they are saying. I mean, it's anything for attention. And rather than us saying that we need to address this seriously, you have politicians and the media that are telling you that you need to feel more and more compassion for these people. Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to feel less and less compassion for these individuals. I feel no compassion whatsoever for Jordan Neely. Let's make that clear. And some of you guys are watching this and you're going to say, well, of course, can't have someone who feels no compassion for him because he's a black man and she never defends black men. No, I never defend black criminals. And I never defend white criminals. I have this thing. It's crazy. I just don't defend criminals. I know it's wild. I just don't come out here out of the gates and feel compassion and emotion for people that are spreading harm in our society..

Audio transcript: I was born with a condition that causes me to hear and see things that aren't really there. It wasn't until I was 7 years old that I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mental disorder that makes it hard for me to tell what's real and what isn't. One day, while I was walking home from school, I heard a voice calling my name. At first, I thought it was my mom, but then the voice spoke again, and this time it sounded different. I turned around and saw a man standing behind me. He was tall and had skin that was a little darker than mine, and he wore a hooded sweater that made him look like a monk. Hello, the man said. I'm sorry, I do not mean any harm. I just wanted to ask you some questions. I didn't know what to do. I had always been told not to talk to strangers, but this man didn't seem scary, and I was curious about what he wanted. What questions? I'm from a group that studies the paranormal, he said. We've been receiving lots of reports of strange things happening in your area, and we thought we'd come investigate. What kind of things? I asked.. Visual transcript: ",

Now, depression doesn't start the day you can't get out of bed. In reality, very few people suddenly become debilitated by depression. Mostly that builds up over years of struggling to keep your head above the water while meeting all of life's expectations at the same time. So you can be deeply suffering with the symptoms of depression, even though you're still getting by doing everything that you're supposed to do. That's why it's called high-functioning depression. And because outwardly, everyone can see how well you're coping with life. So it can be even harder to tell anyone because you feel this deep shame and you can't imagine how anyone would even believe you. So your suffering stays silent. But high-functioning is not the same as happy and healthy. The term high-functioning is not a clinical diagnosis, but depression is. And the fact that you can make it to work or school every day does not mean that your mental health couldn't benefit from some work and some support..

Audio transcript:  Philippians 4 6 says this, do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation by prayer  and petition with thanksgiving, present your request to God. I love those words in every  situation. That means there's nothing too small to bring to him. All of us have experienced worry,  stress, doubt, and anxiety at some point in our lives. We have situations that come against us  that knock us down and make us feel like giving up. Anxiety is incredibly difficult,  but our God is greater. Let me tell you how. The rest of that verse goes on to say this,  and the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and  your minds in Christ Jesus. You see, when we pray, God hears more than we say, answers more than we  ask, and gives more than we can imagine in his own time and in his own way. If you're feeling anxious  today, it's going to be okay. It's not easy to pray when you're in the middle of a storm. Once  you pray and ask God for his help, let go of it.  And leave it in God's hands. Lean on him today, and don't you ever give up.. Visual transcript: WILL YOU TRUST GOD WITH EVERYTHING THAT BURDENS YOUR HEART?❤️❤️❤️\n1 PETER 5:6-7\nAmidst life’s hardships, God lovingly tells us to cast our anxieties on Him (1 Pet. 5:7). He knows our heart and cares deeply about every aspect of our life. As we surrender our fears and worries to Him, we experience the peace that surpasses all understanding and find comfort in His unfailing love.\nIn a world marked by stress and anxiety, God offers an anchor for our restless souls. Many of us are beset by storms and feel as if we must navigate life’s challenges on our own. But the truth is, we have a heavenly Father who is ever-present and eager to handle our anxieties.\nAs believers, we’re not exempt from worry, but we are called to approach our fears with a different perspective. That is, we’re invited to shift our focus from the problems surrounding us to the One who holds the universe in His hands. God’s care for His children is not limited to the grandiose; it extends to the tiniest details of daily life.\nCasting our anxieties upon the Lord is an act of surrender, which requires acknowledging our limitations and embracing His sovereignty. Though submitting in this way may not eliminate life’s challenges, doing so helps us face them with courage and trust.💖💖💖",

Audio transcript: Can you treat seasonal depression? According to the National Institute of Mental Health, can be treated with these four main categories. Number one, light therapy. Exposing yourself to a bright light every day to make up for the diminished natural sunlight in the darker months. Talk therapy. Learning how to cope with difficult situations with cognitive behavioral therapy.

Individuals can use a process called behavioral action in which they find pleasant engaging activities to combat the loss of interest they experience in the winter. Anti-depressant medications.

You have to have two of the five psychotic symptoms. Delusions, which are fixed false beliefs. Something like, your spouse was duplicated from a skin tag taken from the outer quadrant of your calf. Hallucinations, the more common auditory, which are hearing things that aren't there, seeing things that aren't there. Disorganized thinking, you may answer questions in a way that's only slightly related to what the person said. And it makes sense in your mind, but the person listening isn't quite sure what you mean. A fourth symptom, behavior. I've seen people who are so impaired that they smear feces on the wall. Sometimes it can be outbursts of laughing for seemingly no reason. The last manifestation is negative symptoms. It's usually not something that you notice about yourself. What other people will notice is they'll see dramatically decreased facial expressions or complete lack of eye contact or failure to initiate movement or speech..

Audio transcript:  So if you look across forms of psychopathology, like mental illness, the major segment is high levels of negative emotion like depression and anxiety. And a secondary segment is the particular manifestation of that, in your case in body dysmorphia. And so, and then the claims that uninformed mental health professionals make that you're at elevated risk for suicide if you're gender dysphoric is erroneous because the elevated risk for suicide is actually a consequence of the general proclivity for depression and anxiety, and not a specific consequence of the gender dysphoria, or at least that's only a small subcomponent of it. That's another thing to know is that the main clump of psychopathological manifestation, mental illness is centered on heightened levels of negative emotion. And of course that spikes for adolescent girls.. Visual transcript: #jordanpeterson \nWatch the full video here:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6O3MzPeomqs",

Audio transcript:  Brenda and David McDowell.  Hi.  We have triplets.  Oh, look at that.  Triplets that are now 10.  They're 10 years old?  They're 10 now.  Talk about what happened.  Every day in our life was a party.  Every single day they were holding hands, smiling and laughing and looking at each other, engaging in each other.  And we brought them in at nine months and four days.  We were doing one vaccine at a time.  On June 25th, 2007, we brought them in for the pneumococcal shot.  They were no longer engaged in anything or anyone.  They lost their smile.  They just were in their own little separate worlds.  They never held hands again.  They never looked at each other again.  Sorry.  Vaccine injury is real.  We were told it was genetic.  And then we were told by geneticists that there's no possible way three children would shut off on the same day.  That that was absolutely statistically impossible.  So we are the living proof that they're all alive.  We're the living proof.  We're the living proof..

Audio transcript:  I showed at the Healing for the Ages conference, and I will continue to show the whole world that they are reversing, this is not a joke, the symptoms of autism with nicotine patches, the symptoms of ALS with nicotine patches, Parkinson's with nicotine patches, MS with nicotine patches, Alzheimer's with nicotine patches.  They publish this over and over and over, these positive outcomes of mental illness being reversed with nicotine, and that's all they're studying. What are the different doses of nicotine that do this? There is something about nicotine that turns on the neurological function.  I don't know if you know this, but nicotine helps acetylcholine in the brain communicate information. When you're trying to recall information or speak, the only thing that stops that is when acetylcholine is blocked. Well, nicotine turns on how fast acetylcholine can work.  So nicotine administration, patches, you're dealing with ALS, Parkinson's, I don't care, autism, you should start with a 7mg nicotine patch every single day. And you should ask your doctor, why didn't they tell you about nicotine, because there's published studies on all of these I just mentioned being reversed with nicotine, nicotine patches.  In fact, they've got autistic adults who have aggressive behavior, antisocial behavior, they put them on 7mg nicotine patches for one week.  Their aggression and behavior disappeared.  Wow.  Their antisocial behavior. And then they stayed on the nicotine patch every single day and went up to 14mg, 21mg every day for years.  And the only time they saw regression is when they were off the nicotine patch for 2-3 days and they just forgot to wear it.  Wow.  And then they put it back on. All their caregivers, spouses, all reported all their symptoms were all improved with nicotine.  Then you should start asking yourself, why is the United Kingdom, America, Australia, and the United States all against nicotine?  Why is the United Kingdom, America, Australia, and the United States all against nicotine?  Why is the United Kingdom and Australia, New Zealand and Canada all at once, all these five countries, why are they all this year announcing that they are going to be a tobacco-free country by N-20-30?  Oh my gosh...  And why did Joe Biden say last month that they are the first presidency ever in the U.S. history to put a limit and to reduce now the allowed amount of nicotine in every tobacco product in New York?  Man, not anything else, just nicotine.  I should start storing this stuff at the doctor's who left the conference and texted me and my wife.  There's no other reason.  Lots of stuff.  Lots of stuff.  words and said oh my god all i need to do is filter my water and buy up a ton of nicotine  patches after all i showed and just so y'all know at the healing for the ages conference i actually  showed this they took king cobra venom called cobra toxin and cono toxins which is cone snail  venoms that they found in every covid patient and while we were being locked down in our homes  they were injecting those into mammals all around the world and reporting they can create a glial  blastoma brain tumor in less than 72 hours with these venoms that were found in every covid patient  they could create glial blastomas brain tumors in less than 72 hours and they have the slides  and the electron microscope to show you how fast the brain tumor grew within 24 hours 48 hours and  72 hours then they turned around and they administered three doses of nicotine in 72 hours  and found two of the different doses of nicotine totally obliterated the brain tumor in less than  72 hours  hours whoa like disintegrated 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours they show them side by side  you know there's not a single oncologist in the entire world that's using nicotine to combat brain  cancer no they're going to tell you chemotherapy radiation and we need to cut it out they're never  going to tell you but i showed the whole world at the healing for the ages conference how they're  creating these turbo cancers called glioblastomas with venoms in the shots despite proteins of  covid were found to be cobra toxin they're putting those in the shots so when they're  injecting billions of those inside of you it crosses the blood-brain barrier these venoms do  in less than 24 hours they target the glial blastoma section of the brain it's actually  called glioma c6 cells they all have nicotine receptors on them and that's why the venom binds  to them and then it signals to the brain to lay down a whole much a whole lot more nerve cells  over the venom.

Audio transcript:  Negative self-chatter, those nasty things that we say to ourselves, often said to us by adults in our life that we were stupid or crazy or lazy or no good or bad. Many of those nasty messages that we absorb sometimes come out when we get triggered, when we get angry, when we feel demeaned, when we feel unseen. And I need to remind myself that other people also have their story inside them. And when I get triggered by somebody's behavior, it's about my story. Right? And I want to remind myself that they have their story. It's very hard because it's like doing a dance with one another. Because often we cannot dance without stepping on one another's toes..

If you had asked me this in the beginning when I first started making it, my answer would have been, well, as long as you say that you're not 100% sure or that you're not a professional, as long as you put that disclaimer out there for people, then that's good enough. It's not good enough. Whether you're educated or not, whether you have a PhD or not, whether you're a medical professional or not, if you're in this niche and you have a lot of followers or you have a lot of traction, you are an authority.

Visual transcript: My patients with #highfunctioningdepression sometimes aren’t even aware that they are depressed. People think that depression has to lead to impairments in your functioning but this is not the case. If your depression causes significant distress and you are still functioning, you still meet criteria for depression. Many people with HFD don’t enjoy things the way they used to and feel compelled to live “all work and no play” lives because they derive a sense of purpose from their work identity. However, they don’t prioritize the simple pleasures that bring joy to life.  #depression #dayinthelife #hfd #priorities #therapy #psychiatry #shorts \n\nDisclaimer: You may want to consider diagnosis and treatment of symptoms with a licensed medical professional.

It was definitely a first sign of autism that I just didn't recognize. It is one of Sawyer's stems. Sawyer would spin all day long if I would let him. This is, I believe, called a jolly jump up. He would live in this. It was his favorite thing to do. I mean Sawyer wasn't even walking yet and he was figuring out a way to spin. Sawyer would look for any opportunity to get that stem that he needed. He loved this tire swing. He would stay at the park all day and just want to do this. When Sawyer finally figured out he could spin himself, this is what he would do all day long. It was a challenge because sometimes he would run into walls or others. Most of the time he was so good at spinning he could keep himself safe. Sawyer is definitely an expert spinner. This is his favorite thing to do..

Audio transcript: Two main reasons why it's important for the average Muslim. One is that I think we need to get away from this stigma of mental health being something that is reserved just for people who have problems. And we really need to, as a community, embrace that everybody needs to do work on themselves. And that we're all works in progress and it's just a continuum. It's not necessarily those people who have mental health issues and then the normal people, but there's a spectrum in between and we need to embrace this idea of looking at ourselves and doing work on ourselves. The second reason is from the study of Islamic psychology or understanding Islam through the lens of psychology, what I find that it does for people is that it really gives them a deeper insight into Islam, the religion of Islam as a path for living life as a human being..

I could get a call from my agent saying that I need to speak in front of 2 million people tomorrow about knitting and I wouldn't care. And I know nothing about knitting. I can't empathize with myself and that includes future Kineca. Not having anxiety and nervousness makes me do some really stupid things. And I never learn from my mistakes. People tell me I'm very charming and charismatic to talk to. I think this is because I feel no nervousness and therefore there's no barrier between me and them. I allow people to be themselves and then I just mirror what they are. Sociopaths are generally very good at job interviews because we lack the nervousness that regular people have. Plus we'll say anything to get the job. Our rosymeys may be creative. I may or may not speak 6 languages including Swahili and I'm a professional stop woman according to my resume..

But my point in talking about this is that mental health is talked about too much is better to not talk about it. It used to be something that people were embarrassed about. You wouldn't want to tell people. Now people make it their personality trait. People put it in their bio on Twitter depressed with two stars, like ironically calling themselves depressed. And that's going to make you even more depressed. Definitely should not put depressed in your bio. Let's say you went through an incident where something really bad happened. It was nothing you could have done to control it. That's yeah, of course. Talk about it..

Audio transcript:  I believed that if I was thin, if I weighed this magical number on the scale, then I was strong, then I was free, then I was worthy of love. But I had a crisis. See, I was engaged to get married, and I got so depressed that I outgrew the wedding dress. I had bought a wedding dress in the hope that I would be able to lose enough weight to wear it, but instead I gained so much weight, they couldn't even zip it up. I remember falling on my face and saying, God, now that I've become a Christian, I am fat. Like it was his fault. He was like, I didn't make you eat that whole row of chocolate chip cookie dough. I didn't make you eat that Domino's Pizza by yourself. Listen, he said, you have an idol, and he said, give this to me. I remember thinking, but that's a carnal thing. It's the carnal thing. He said, anything that has control over you is a concern for me..

In other words, are you really depressed if you can feel good for part of the day? Usually we think of someone who is moderately too severely depressed as being very sad and unresponsive to things, but that isn't always how it looks. But when it does look like this, we call it having melancholic features or a melancholic depression. When someone is able to have a good day or enjoy some things, we call it having atypical features or an atypical depression. With atypical depression, you can brighten up when something good happens. It is a momentary brightening though, and it's not something that you feel for weeks, but you can feel like your mood has lifted usually in response to a positive event, like a party or watching a good movie. With melancholic depression, you don't have much positive response when good things happen. You just feel really low and it just seems like nothing can lift you up..

Audio transcript:  because I don't think women are happy, I don't think men are happy, and I don't think that they experience depression the same way. Women tend to experience depression in a much more environmental sense, meaning they are directly affected by their environment. If they're unhappy, I think that makes them depressed. Men experience depression when there's no way out of that environment. I think that we are perfectly okay with going through something, but if we don't see a way out, because of all the progress that women have made, we've had to tilt the scales so you guys have a greater advantage in pretty much every aspect of life. And men just don't see that light at the end of the tunnel. That's why we just kill ourselves. That's why the common thing is like, well, yeah, men are more likely to kill themselves, but women are more likely to attempt it. Okay, well, why would that be? Because women are like, I'm upset, I'm in a man, and men are just like, yeah, I'm not going to get out of this, and they blow their head off or something. I think that speaks to the differences in our natural predispositions as men and as women, and I think that we need to acknowledge that for what it is and restore what would be considered a more traditional set of gender roles in society..

Audio transcript:  How was it affecting your day-to-day, both professionally and personally, because you're dealing with this.  It's not a secret.  They notice it, but it's not diagnosed.  And the problem is there, but it's not.  It's not been named.  It was extremely hard, but I had normalized it so much.  I, you know, like you said earlier, when you have so many people saying things to you online, I'm tough as nails, but it gets to you.  And you kind of, you, it's, I would be lying if I said that it didn't affect me.  And so when I hear people saying all you do is eat and you eat, it's like you almost believe it, even though I know I'm not.  So it was extremely isolating.  It was lonely.  And I will say that getting a diagnosis does feel wonderful, but it is extremely lonely.  It's, sometimes I...  I really fight with the shame of it, which I think is the hardest part.  But how are you dealing with regaining your voice, your message, and the intention of the message that you wanted on Instagram, which is, this is my journey, and I know I'm not alone.  How are you resetting this for you and to help other people who want to hear it?  I just take it day by day.  Like today, I tried to feed myself.  Didn't do that great.  And...  Like one of your guests said earlier, I just try to be gentle with myself.  I try to remind myself that how I'm feeling, if I'm having these bad feelings, is temporary.  And I also take...  I take immense pride in the fact that...  I understand that I was given this platform originally for modeling.  Not given.  I busted my ass.  I don't know if I can say ass.  I busted my butt.  To get here.  But I feel immense gratitude and pride that I am able to sit here with you and talk about such hard things and know that there's somebody on the other side that feels less alone.  That maybe says to themselves, I'm going to get help.  Asks for help.  Starts taking care of themselves in the way that they deserve.  Because, you know, plus size or not, we all...  Everybody deserves food.  Everybody deserves to eat.  You know?  We deserve to take care of ourselves.  And we deserve to live without judgment.  We do.  We do.  Yes.  That's the biggest thing in all of this.  Are you currently in therapy?  How often are you in treatment?  Yeah, so I see my dietician once a week.  And then I have my therapist once a week.  And...  And I have a lot of people in my life who lovingly just nudge me, nudge me along the right path.  And, yeah, I'm doing it.  You are doing it.  You're doing it.  Thank you so much, Tess.  I appreciate you joining us.  It means the world to me.  And please come back anytime because my platform is your platform.

There are a lot of reasons for that. One of the reasons is that we often don't give ourselves time to wind down before bed and yeah, that sounds boring, right? So like finding something to do to wind down that's interesting enough that you don't mind transitioning to it but not so engaging that it keeps us from going to sleep is kind of that sweet spot. So trading massages with a partner, doing some puzzles, reading a book, watching a TV show that you've seen before so it's not not all that interesting, listening to a podcast, these are all great ways to wind down before sleep and we want to start doing it well before bedtime..

So toe walking is kind of walking on your tiptoes when you know you see people do this and kids do this quite often but autistic people will toe walk more often than not. Okay so non-facial expressions. Autistic people have an issue where their facial expressions may not match up to what they're thinking or feeling. Number three is monotone talking. You may have a very monotonal talking voice where everything will just be completely one tone and there will be no deviation from this actual type of conversation. Okay so number four are ticks. You know maybe you jump or you cough or you hit your throat or you like click your finger. Okay so number five is poor motor skills. Yeah I use fidget gadgets and little fidget things to kind of help improve basically the way my my fine water skills are developing because my fine water skills are absolutely atrocious..

Audio transcript:  My wish for World Mental Health Day would be to normalise mental health amongst young people.  My wish for World Mental Health Day is that everyone feels seen no matter where they are,  how they are. My message to the government would be that we want to be heard, young people want to  be included. I'm 18 in a few months, I'm able to vote so are a lot of my peers so we want to see  the government prioritising mental health and that early intervention. People my age would  definitely say that the space at the moment is absolutely complex and it's just an ever-growing  problem considering the cost of living crisis and then people my age are starting college,  just going to college. Their choices in college and what they want to do with their future is  so limited it's disheartening and discouraging for them. It's quite ironic the budget day is  on mental health and mental health care. It's quite ironic the budget day is on mental health  and mental health care. It's quite ironic the budget day is on mental health and mental health  care. It's quite ironic the budget day is on mental health and mental health care. It would be good  to see if they even mention it because obviously it's going to have some effects on people.  Show that you care, show the young people that you care, do your research because I think often  or not they haven't even a clue what mental health is or how much the young people of Ireland  are suffering.. Visual transcript: The Irish government is one of the main reasons why there is so much bad mental health and suicides for teens and young adults in Ireland, but these naive students believe that the government actually cares. These young students have a hard lesson to learn.",

When you starve the body, that's why people do these fastings in many religions.  When you starve the body, there's almost a mental clarity that takes over.  And that's what I think becomes addicting for most people.  Like for me, it was never about weight.  And for most people, it's not about weight.  When you learn about anorexia, they tell you that it's usually a manifestation of people  trying to assert control over their lives.  And that's what it is.  It's the one thing you can control when you feel like there's chaos is what you put in  your mouth and your body.  So that was for me, after going through a unique situation and feeling that my whole  life was out of control, I just manifested as an eating disorder.  And I had it for four years on and off.  But like, you know, pretty, if you saw pictures, I mean, I was like 30 pounds skinnier, maybe  even 40 pounds skinnier than I am now, which is insane..

Boys are nearly 5 times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with ASD. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disability that often presents with challenges before the age of 3 and lasts throughout a person's lifetime. There is currently no medical detection blood test or cure for autism spectrum disorder. Being non-verbal at age 4 does not mean that a child with autism will never speak. Hyperlexia, the ability to read above one's age or grade level in school, commonly accompanies autism spectrum disorder. There is no cure for ASD, but there are several interventions that can help children learn important skills that improve everyday life.. Visual transcript: Help me create more videos.

I feel in today's time and hour with the kind of information that's available and accessible, it's natural people will reach out for information. In fact, I encourage people to learn and read about mental health. It's also going to be the case that you need to be careful about the credibility of the source. Are you reading an expert's opinion? And another part of it is don't self-diagnose, more importantly don't take self-treatment. What you do is if you gather information, utilize it and if there is help that's needed, go ahead and seek it. Thank you..

Audio transcript: Here are some more symptoms of ADHD in women. From a fellow ADHDite, ADHDin? I have ADHD. So having ADHD doesn't mean that you can't pay attention. It means that you want to pay attention to everything. In women, the hyperactivity is much more mental than it is physical. So my brain is constantly going a million miles an hour and that's often reflected in how quickly I can speak. It also doesn't mean that you're a bad student. I graduated high school with a 4.2 GPA and I graduated college Magnum Cum Laude. I can do work very quickly but I often make careless mistakes so I would turn in an assignment but I'd forget to put my name on it. I'm terrible at responding to texts and emails because in my mind every message is a new task and it becomes very overwhelming very quickly. I really don't like watching movies but I can binge watch a TV show because there's built-in breaks between episodes. I'm always interrupting people when they're talking to me because they'll say something and that will make me think of something and I want to say it to them before I forget. I constantly have music and phrases stuck in my head. It is never quiet in my brain.. Visual transcript: https:\/\/youtu.be\/ozFGCZOwlxY",

I guess I'm a recovering physician, you could say.  So I started off my career in psychiatry and forensic psychiatry  and was involved in working with patients in some unusual settings like in jails  and also did a lot of expert witness work and research.  I was an academic physician at the beginning of my career.  And over time, through my personal experience and through reading the research literature,  I began to realize that psychiatric drugs at first, because that was in my specialty,  not only were not actually effective, but actually responsible for causing quite significant harm,  including dying sooner than necessary from just from taking psychiatric drugs  and multiple classes of psychiatric drugs.  And this sort of led me on a path first to be much more conservative in my prescribing practices  and eventually just taking all patients off medicines.. Visual transcript: During my stay at Confluence, I had a great conversation with Luke Storey about my past and why I left the allopathic medical system, how I turned over a new leaf, and became a natural healing expert.\n“Are psychiatric drugs really the cause of violent tendencies?”\n“What are the most harmful effects of psychiatric drugs?”\n“Why is the ‘bio-lab’ theory so beneficial for the medical establishment?”\nStick around until the very end, and find out the answers to these questions, and much more!",

Use the authority that's been given to you through the power of the Holy Spirit to speak to those lies, to speak to that anxiety. You are not an anxious person trying to get free from your anxiety. You are already free fighting off attacks of anxiety. Demonstrate the Holy Spirit power in you that exists and is alive and strong and perfect. And use it to speak to that anxiety and pray and ask God and receive for healing and peace. In Jesus' name I claim amen. God bless you. Follow for more prayers.. Visual transcript: ",

Then to the hospital and got medicated and came down and realized, oh, I don't really actually like crystals.. Visual transcript: One of the most common symptoms of mania is compulsive spending and it's often on things you normally have no interest in. I had no idea what mania even was when I became obsessed with Crystals and started spending every dollar I had and a lot of money I didn't have on them. Eventually my mania turned into psychosis and I was taken to the mental hospital where I discovered I had Bipolar Disorder, which in so many ways has changed my life for the better. In a way, these Crystals saved my life but not in the way some people claim they do.\n\n#bipolar #bipolar1 #bipolardisorder #mania #mentalhealth #mentalillness #mentalhealthawareness",

Audio transcript:  so a massive school district in canada called hwdsb just mandated masks on all the children  50 000 children affected now they're letting people opt out at this point but we know how  commies love to move the goalposts so i think this is a foot in the door tactic and then we'll  have the mission creep and the disallowing of exemptions into the future now this is a widely  unpopular decision i can tell from social media and this huge protest that happened around this  meeting here are some of the photos my kids my choice this is from bobby histrova on twitter  who was there you're not my mom we have rights this sign says masks make me sick no mask symbol  they rigged who was allowed in it sounds like they curated who was allowed in to try to maximize the  number of masked people  so they wouldn't have as much opposition but despite rigging the audience they still were  heckled and outrageously they cleared the room they made everybody leave except for the so-called  trustees so i have a number of clips that i want to play here look at what they said on their slide  about mask inventory and costing estimated cost five hundred thousand dollars per month  which when you have fifty thousand kids  is ten dollars a month those probably are some pretty low quality chinese masks probably  laden with all sorts of cancer-causing chemicals but look at this they approximate june 30th 2023  as the end of this heinous mask mandate putting the estimated cost at 3.5 million dollars  absolute betrayal it's such a sociopathic power play too they're like it's not a bad thing but you  can't fix it no more it's far too late and it's far too late and i'm not saying we should Google some  masks the exact recommended masks that people are sending to us because we might need to do 12 for a positive  not a mandate but it's called a mandate it's called a mask requirement um that staff operationalize  a temporary universal masking requirement with an unrestricted option to opt out in all hwdsb  schools and that the temporary requirement be renewable at first board meeting in january is  that correct that's correct well we're calling it a universal masking requirement if there's an  unrestricted option to opt out um it's not really a mandate and i think that's sort of the key point  is we're not asking for a mandate we're looking to improve masking by making it a quote-unquote  requirement they want to force people to do what they want but then they're like oh yeah there's  this little loophole if you know about it you can opt out so you can't say that we're mandating it  they made a whole ado out of saying the word requirement that's what this was about people  can still get out of it  by quote opting out but the whole point was to put a requirement into place  and then they say well you can't really call it a requirement so they brought in a doctor  to lecture us about how full the hospitals are something sounds off about this guy  thank you for having me i'm a pediatrician in hamilton and my family live in ward one.

If you come to really understand the truth revealed within this powerful Scripture, that truth will free you from the grip of fear. But this must be more than just something that you acknowledge or understand in your natural mind. This is a truth you have to receive in your spirit. Here's the verse, Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee. The key to peace is focus on and trust in God. As simple as that might sound, it's not always easy to do. When you focus on your troubles, you inspire fear. When you focus on Jesus, you inspire faith. Now, this doesn't mean that you should just ignore life's troubles. This just means that you should keep life's troubles in perspective by looking at God's ability. Fear asks what if faith boldly declares even if.. Visual transcript: #Shorts\n\nThis verse has the power to help you overcome anxiety.\n\nWant more content?

So someone asked me, how do we control performance anxiety or exam stress? So I'm going to share a tip with you that worked for me. So when we have an anxiety, it's about the future, right? But the only thing that we have is this present moment right here, right now. So instead of thinking about the outcome, which is out of our control and the future is out of our control, let's focus on the present moment because the present moment is the only moment that exists and it's under our control. So by focusing on this moment and the efforts that we put in for the exam or other event, then we are actually ensuring our success. So let's focus on the present moment and the process and our effort so that we can have a beautiful result and beautiful future. If your mind does take you to these scary scenarios in the future, then just bring it back to the present moment and remind it that we have to focus on here and now. This is the only thing under our control and this is the secret of success.. Visual transcript: ",

Audio transcript:  The American Pronunciation Guide Presents ''How to Pronounce Validated''  Psychiatry in all of this time doesn't have one case report of one disease validated, not one.  What they do is they meet at the American Psychiatric Association,  they meet in the DSM Committee, Diagnostic Statistical Manual Committee,  and they vote on making new behavioral and emotional disorders,  and they vote, and then they start immediately calling them diseases.  And they tell people, they tell the public these are diseases. Total fraud. Total fraud.  The actual truth about chemical balance  is that it's an actual lie.  Nobody has yet measured, demonstrated, or created a test  to show that somebody has a chemical imbalance in their brain. Period.  What the American public should be thinking about  is when they or their loved ones or their friends  have received a psychiatric diagnosis,  they should be asking the dog, the cheese dog,  where's the chemical test for that?  Where is the objective test for this?  And I guarantee you that there will be  people who will be told,  we don't have a chemical test for that.  There are no biological tests for any mental illnesses that I'm aware of.  There are not current available tests to verify your diagnosis.  There is no test. There is no specific test to differentiate between,  let's say schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  Not a single test.  There are no, not really confirmatory tests for the diagnosis.  There is no test, there's no biopsy you can do  that says this person is depressed, this person is bipolar.  We don't have anything really currently to identify mental illness per se.  No, there are no specific tests to confirm the diagnosis  to show the improvement like any blood tests or any x-rays or anything like that.  In my practice I don't do any tests.  I just speak with people and listen to them  and then I make a decision in what kind of illness there should be.  We don't have, we don't really have any specific blood tests  or other tests that are definitive for any mental illness whatsoever.  What kind of biological tests do we have available today  for detecting mental illnesses?  None.  There is no rational science behind what they think is the cause of these symptoms.  The medications that are being given to people are without exception  introducing chemicals that are altering the brain in ways which can be very damaging.  And I'll go a step further and say that in the absence of a proven chemical imbalance  for which the medications are, quote, rebalancing or fixing,  the medications are in fact toxic.  How many patients have you been able to cure so far?  I would say one.  How many people have I cured?  Well, there are no real cures right now in psychiatry.  Ha ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  You ask me about the issue about how many people I've cured,  I don't know that any of us are ever completely cured of anything.  I have not been able to cure many patients.  I have cured none of my patients.  I have not been able to cure any of my patients.  So you have to ask the classic Roman question, legal question,  cui bono?  Who benefits?  The people who make the diagnosis.  The people who make the diagnosis.  The people who make the diagnosis.  The people who make the diagnosis.  you try.  I see.  Which you, for instance, have been realized about.  Are you able today to identify who that person is?  Can I have your scientific advice on how to treat these patients?  I am trying to understand the Tylenol.  I don't know how you can know what it is,  because I've always wondered about that one in my life and yet have not decided how to treat this patient better.  All right, I'm really interested to hear your answer to these questions.. Visual transcript: Perhaps we should look deeper before blindly trusting \"authorities\" with our mental health.",

I knew once I started getting an audience, it couldn't just be about me and sharing in a comedic way all the time. There had to be more depth to it because I now have a little bit of responsibility to positively affect people. And so sharing my therapy sessions or stories about addiction and just showing that I, while am kind of on the other side, it's always a work in progress. Chris, you can't do that face every time you fry. I was ready to give up on everything that I dreamed of as a kid and then found this one app that happened to change my life, everything.
