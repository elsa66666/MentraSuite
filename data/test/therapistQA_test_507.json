In college he had a short phase where he was a bit more social. It is now about 4 years since he has graduated college. In that time he has not worked any job. He gets angry when people try to tell him to think about the future and what he wants to do with his life. He lives alone in an apartment that my parents own in Queens (we live on Long Island). He barely goes outside. He orders things to his apartment, even food so he doesnt go outside (he doesn't know how to drive either). He mainly just plays video games online and sleeps. It seems like he has some hidden form of cash flow that we do not know of since he buys himself things on Amazon quite frequently. He is extremely moody and can get in quite negative angry moods towards others. This has been 4 years and I am not sure what to do. He himself does not seem open for us trying to help, when my parents try to have a more serious talk with him he gets extremely angry and then will say extreme things to get them to stop talking, like \u201cThis will be the last you will ever see me. I will move to Sweden\u201d (he is currently dating a girl online from Sweden who has recently come to visit him in NY).

I feel I am useless to my kids or my husband because of the psychological problems I cannot be normal. I cannot hold down a job. I have been treated since 2001 and nothing has worked. The fear I have of going out in public is the worst. The panic attacks and anxiety is so difficult on my body. I have thought of suicide before but I could never do that because of my kids that need me here. I often have disturbing thoughts that come from nowhere and I am alone most of the day. During this time I tend to sink deeper into my depression. I feel fatigued constantly and have no motivation to do even simple things around the house. My memory has become worse in just a short time. I cannot remember things that were said to me or that I say even within an hour ago. I repeat myself a lot because I don't remember anything or who I told. Is there any hope for someone in my situation? I feel like I suffer from so much that I have reached a point of no way out. No treatment has worked, and the meds just get me through day to day, but I still can't go out in public even with the medicines. I need help. Please.",

When I go over to his house, his father is always drunk, yelling at the tv or his granddaughter in profane language. His mother has never shown an ounce of intrest in him when im there, and has not even bothered to enroll him back into highschool after he was expelled when a student attacked him. He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD, and was on pills for sometime, but his parents took him off for some reason\u2026..They dont have health insurance for him, and he hasn't been to a doctor in over 2 years. It has gotten to the point where he is going to ask his grandmother if she can take him to the doctor. He also has this randomly recurring, excruciating pain in his ribs every so often,lasting anywhere from a minute to several hours. since he was a child and no doctor could diagnose it. i think it may be all the extreme stress\u2026He went through tremendous physical abuse at a younger age, and constant moving from home to home. I want to help him get past this and heal his emotional wounds so he can make a great life for himself. Last night he was going through a really rough time, and actually scared me with what he expressed about his feelings. He has no other family members, in town, other than his two adult sisters that moved into an apartment together 10 minutes away\u2026. however he cannot stay there because they recently had a baby and the boyfriend is living with them. his parents continuously put him down and tell him how worthless he is, and how they're kicking him out the second he turns 18. He says he just wants parents who ask how you're feeling, say i love you and how your day was\u2026 but he has never had that. he comes home to drinking and smoking and screaming. This past week he has started his first job, working for a contracting company doing under the table work like hanging dry wall and packing mud, he is really exited to be making money and i want to help him figure out a savings plan so he can move out when he turns 18. im sorry this is so long, i just wanted to tell you the whole situation, and i just want someone to give me some advise on how to help him move on from his parents and love himself.

I've been treated for depression and anxiety since then and, because nothing has come up since about 2011, I have not opened up about other issues. But lately I can feel something coming on again. Every few months I would go through a few weeks to months of delusions, hallucinations and mood swings usually resulting in me sequestering myself from church, school, friends or whatever else I was involved in. I had a recurring experience of a demonic familiar, visiting other dimensions, and shadow people that seemed to stop when I got a custom tattoo on my back that is an alchemical symbol for demon warding. But it's starting to slip back. I'm distracted, hear and see things that startle me, and recently put myself in the hospital again when I got so agitated that I cut myself deep enough to damage a tendon. My problem is I just can't open up in person about exactly what is going on; I feel it coming back like someone following me down a sidewalk, like drowning placidly. I guess what worries me is that I know I'm going somewhere that will harm me but it is familiar and in many ways more real as if it replaces my daily life. Have you ever passed out when really drunk and just before you do you feel like you're falling into a deep hole that will certainly kill you? It's like that. I just can't get myself to talk about it. In the past few weeks I have seen both of my doctors and didn't feel like wasting their time with this. How can I open up before I no longer feel that it is necessary?

He used to play cricket, go bell-ringing, go running but now he doesn't have any hobbies and doesn't have much h time for anything other than work because my mother can't deal with the pressure of work she hasn't got a very good job and often will take time off. And now that her father is ill, she's taken even more time off to look after him and puts pressure on my dad to bring more income in. My father is often tired and stressed and my mother gets anxious even more than she used to now that grandpa is very ill and will often take out her anger or stress on us and will make scenes and leave the house for a few days. This isn't unusual, she would often leave the house when I was young and claim that she was going to divorce my dad on regular basis, tho she never did, when this happened she would act very childishly. She has periods where she'll be super loving towards me and others when she's very unkind and insensitive and takes out anger towards me which means I find it hard to trust her, even though I know she isn't a bad person. At the moment I'm taking my GCSE's and I also have a Saturday job which means I don't have as much time to relax, and I'm not allowed to have social media or see my friends very often which frustrates me. I also have a best friend who nearly committed suicide and spending time with them can be damaging to my mental health although I love them to pieces. I have three main problems, my mum, my grandpa and my best friend and I find it hard to have enough time to be there for them and I feel so useless. I'm not sure how to get my mum help because she often denies that she has anxiety and will get very angry, luckily my best friend is getting help and I'm always making an effort to support them and they're getting better.",

I think he doesn't care because he's always picking a fight with me and he's blaming every fight on me saying I started it like a child. Every time we fight he always leaves and when he comes back he acts like nothing happened, like all the cursing and the hurt feeling were nothing. I try to tell him leaving is not the answer and that if he wants things to get better that we need to talk things through. I'm constantly telling him that and he just does it again. In our relationship when one of us does something wrong we have to apologize. He's been at fault for so many fights thats he literally said he's tired of apologizing and doesn't want to say it anymore. Earlier in our relationship he had been talking to other girls, cheating on me and I still have no idea why I stay with him. Part of me thinks its because I love him and I've been with him for so long, and another part of me thinks I wasted all my time with this one guy and I just can't throw it away now, he met my family he does everything with us, my nephew loves him, every one of my classmates look up to us for staying together throughout high school which is rare. I recently fought with him cuz he had told me he was going to come over cuz I had pulled through a horrible night with his family. He bailed on me and so I didn't talk to him. He said if I didn't text him back he would get a twitter or instagram and it bothers me because lots of girls add him and as you can see I don't trust him. I ignored him and he got an instagram. so that made me furious that I broke up with him yesterday. I'm having trouble coaping with this that I always come running back to him because I miss him, but then again we fight again. I dont know what to do. Please give me advice.",

In the last 4 years, she has become paranoid\u2013someone is stealing electricity, wifi, cable, cell phone service, water. We didn't even have wifi or cable at the time. I even checked the water and electric usage, but found they were consistent with usage at other addresses. Then she decided someone must be at home at all times because someone is sneaking into the apartment\u2013to mistreat our pets, to fiddle with the electricity, to steal services, to live in the attic. She also claims someone had wired the apartment to listen to us, wired the front door so it would randomly open, stole our forks (I don't know where they went), stole the Mummy dvd (we have at least 100 dvds, but that one was the only one taken, sneaks through the ventilation, stops by and electrocutes her around 3 a.m. on random mornings, and added wires under the driver side of my car (don't worry she pulled out). Someone disrupts the signal on her analog radio, she insists all power, circuit breakers be off, and the major appliances unplugged except for the refrigerator and a few lamps. She says her last 5 cell phones were hacked and taken over by someone. I have never experienced or witnessed any of the problems she claims. So she accuses me of helping the someone because I say none of these issues can be proven. She won't see a doctor, and she can pass any mental test. Honestly, I wander if she is a dick rather than sick. These incidents have been continual at 3 dif ferent addresses. In the one address, the landlord said she could not live there any more because she was entering the basement and changing the handyman's repairs. (I don't know if this accusation is true; she denies it.) At one point nearly 2 years ago, I expressly asked her not to destroy the landlord's county letter because it itemized repairs to the house. She ignored my request and ripped up the documents. I gave her $4000 (my savings) and my car and kicked her out of my apartment two years ago, so she stayed with my aunt for a week, in hotels for about a month. Then she came back for another $2000 (payday loans). Eventually, she spoke with the VA hospital, received a bed at a homeless shelter, and money to return to school. They also offered to pay for housing, but she couldn't find a place she was comfortable with for the money offered. After a few months in the shelter, she \u201ccouldn't\u201d make it to the shelter by curfew, so she was kicked out and moved in with me again. Within a year, we moved again. About 8 months ago, we were evicted from a house (only 5 months into a year lease) because \u201csomeone\u201d had cut out all the copper connecter in the electrical outlets (a fire hazard), had cut a large outdoor cord connecting the central air to the house, and had removed insulation and created holes in the outer walls. I cannot prove it was my mom, but no one else was in the house. She or I am always home. Now we're in an apartment and she opens the outlets and has cut the connectors to the phone jacks. She still experiences are all of the aforementioned issues. I discovered she had pulled wires beneath the driver's seat of my 8 month old car. She claims someone is hacking into its system. I plan to move because of unrelated issues, but because of my mom, I am hesitating. I am sick of the problems. I am sick of her refusing to listen to reason. I told her 5 months ago that I wanted to go separate ways with this move. I tried to give her time to find an apartment, get a job, request government assistance (she hasn't worked since 2010), but she has proven she unwilling to take care of herself. She wants me to buy her a Winnebago, so she can live in the woods with her dog and cat. I am tempted because I don't want to continue this cycle anymore. I don't want her to live with me. I don't even want her to know where I live. I don't even feel guilty about it any more because every time I find something she \u201cfixed\u201d I just cry. However, I feel bad for the dog and cat since I've had them for years. I feel guilty because there are no other siblings or family\u2026 just me. This situation feels like the rest of my life.

Most every time I talk with him, he has something negative to say about me. Something I didn't do right. This is really starting to wear on me. My Self Esteem is pretty bad and this makes it worse. I also get very anxious when I know he's coming home soon, because I know it is going to be constant critiques. Also, when I ask him if he wants to go someplace with me and the kids, he never wants to and gets upset about it. I get in a bad mood too and he ends up leaving.

Nothing gets resolved. I work from home and it's difficult because I am also watching the kids. He doesn't like anyone else watching the kids so I try to the majority of the time, unless I have somewhere important to go to. We used to be a lot different. We would go out to dinner, shopping, ext. We would watch TV together and he really didn't critique me all too much. He used to say good things about me in which he doesn't say anymore. For example, he used to call me \u201cpretty girl\u201d. He has not said that for awhile now. We have also went through some crap that hurt our relationship.

He's never really dealt with his emotions about his past, although he is a sensitive guy and I know he has a lot of hurt inside him. He has instead chosen to repress and ignore these emotions. He moved across country, so his family is out of sight, out of mind. He will do anything to distract himself and not think about it. He definitely has shown signs of depression on and off over the years. I've suggested therapy to him before. It comes up perhaps once a year. He is extremely reluctant and he says has no desire to relive his terrible past. I've told him I understand that and that I think while therapy would be painful, I believe it would be worth it in the end. He's extremely stubborn and pushing an issue will make him more likely to reject it, so I don't bring this up often. My approach is to discuss it in a supportive manner, encourage help, not push it, leave it to germinate. It seems to have made him open up to the possibility of help. He has conceded in the past year that he might be depressed. We recently visited his adoptive parents. It had been 3-4 years since he had seen them, because they live back \u201chome\u201d and he's been avoiding his past entirely. His foster father is very old and unwell. He put off seeing them as long as he could. I encouraged him to go visit, because the guilt at not going was evident and I knew he would have terrible regrets if his foster father died and he had not gone to see him in so long. I know he feels a lot of guilt for being so far from them, especially now they are old and unwell. He approached me today and stated he thinks he is depressed. I think this is a huge step for him to admit this. I want him to get the help he needs. I will of course, be supportive and will listen to anything he wants to talk about. I do strongly believe that therapy would be invaluable to him. How do I encourage this route without scaring him back into his shell? Thank you.",

Once I told my Dad and he went in to a fit of rage and threatened my mother that he would take me and since then I got scared to share with my Dad so I only had my sister to really lean on to.

He tends to NOT be helpful or kind and is causing himself many issues. He's had several school detentions for doing things such as name-calling or being disrespectful to his teachers. He is involved in scouting and loves it, but won't listen to adult leaders or scout leaders. He's had privileges taken away, and will now need to have his scouting experiences limited as he is not reliable in that setting. He doesn't want his behaviors restricted but I can't have him acting out everywhere. He is developing a reputation as kind of a jerk. His dad and I have divorced 5 years ago and he sees us both regularly and he also has a stepdad in his life that he cares about. All the parents are engaged to assist him in getting what he needs. I have a flexible work arrangement and am able to be home most days right after school gets out. I help with homework, we eat meals together\u2013I've made a point to tell him in no uncertain terms that my love for him is unconditional. My other kid exhibits none of these behaviors.

He wandered off at a recent scout outing doing something that could have endangered himself and there will be consequences for that. So far, being grounded, having detentions, etc don't really seem to matter to him. He gets really wound up and doesn't listen and it feels like attention seeking behavior.

She starts by claiming the neighbors below her are playing music at night keeping her awake. However, they're not. She continues to build on this narrative saying that they turn the music on at times like when she goes to bed. That they're also playing recorded audio like dialogue from a tv show and that they play it forwards and backwards. Then it progresses to the stage that the neighbors are listening to her. That they turn the music, etc. off when she begins talking as in a phone conversation. During the first incident a few years ago, she claimed the neighbor had installed listening devices in the walls to monitor her. Also during the first incident, when I told her I could not hear anything, she became vicious and verbally attacked me. Claimed I had hearing problems, needed hearing aids and was just lying to be mean to her. She eventually made contact with the neighbor during the first incident and accused him of playing music at night. Needless to say, that did not go over well. She ended up moving apartments within the complex. In regards to the 2nd, current incident, she asked me the other day if I knew how much it would be to hire a detective. Approaching this from a rational standpoint, stating facts like there is no music is not working. She completely ignores reality like the fact that my hearing is much better than hers and has convinced herself that the narrative in her head is real. I am very stressed out and worried that this is a sign of a greater problem and that she will be kicked out of her apartment. I also have no idea what to do.

I was part of a healing group and had one to one healing where i told him everything about my love, fears, hopes. it was helping so i invited the girl along so he could help her. He started to divulge things to her i had said in confidence and pay her lots of attention. i had to stop going for a while but then asked him if he was seeing her. he said he was human but also he wouldnt do that. i couldnt ask her because she was always asking me to let go. five agonising months later, not knowing fully, she told me she was pursued by him and she eventually gave in. She got dumped after a week and he started seeing someone else from the group and i believe they are still together and happy, which is great. My ex was vulnerable, afterall it was a healing group. Apparantely, everything i told him about her on our healing sessions made him want her for himself. he took her away on a shaman retreat and one thing led to another. when he stopped it after the weekend he said she had too many issues for him. she never wanted him, she just went along with it but now knows she was duped and i feel so angry and hateful. Had they gone on and had a relationship i would stand back and be happy but we both feel so much worse and the lessons are vague. i told him my worst fear and he made it come true. he said he just reflected my fear in his action which is just the sort of garbage i would expect from him now i know his ego and intentions took over. if i thought he was a predator i would write something on his healing forum but i would have to back up my story which means going public with our names. he offends my sense of decency and has caused me so much emotional distress. i know i have to forgive him for my sake but there is acceptance and there is acquiescence, which means i will accept it but need to protest. do i let it go or dig it all up?",

I no longer have strong impulses to commit suicide, although these visual thoughts and impulses has changed into hurting or even killing others. I am a visual thinker, which I guess is why these thoughts seems so lifelike. These thoughts also come very sudden, and are related to the present situation I am in. I am right now in a relationship with my girlfriend and we have a child (2 years old) and two cats. I have had previous thoughts of harming my girlfriend, which is usual to me since I get these thoughts often towards other humans. On the other hand it started bothering me when I got very strong, visual impulses to hurt our infant child. I got real reason to worry since I have never been good to remember any dreams, but the last two or three I can remember involves harming or killing our daughter, which is very distressfull. Sometimes these impulses can be very hard to handle, which is the reason why I chose to register on this website. We got a new kitten the other day, and even that she is in a new location, she has adapted very well. But due to something as simple as her not wanting a cuddle drove both thoughts and action to treat her very aggressively and rough. Stopping myself from harming it, I had to sit alone in 15 minutes to calm myself down. I am concerned that if I can't control my impulses to something as innocent as a kitten, what can happen in the future towards my daughter? Thanks for helping.",

IT's just these thoughts are scaring me and make me think that I might be getting schizophrenia , or the onset of it\u2026This is all I can think about, I try to go out and there are days where I have better days and seem happy and normal but then the worse days come too. I also thought I have schizophrenia because as I was falling asleep I would have a lot of chaotic thoughts in my head, not voices but random song lyrics popping up , scaring me to think I'm going crazy.

Before I turned 10, my childhood was good and I have fond memories of my family hanging out / doing activities together. However, after reaching the age of 10, my father just stopped bothering to spend time with his children. Over the years he acts like he wants to hang out but when time rolls around for the activity to take place, always comes up with excuse to not hang out (be it family activities or spending time with individual family members). This obviously hurt my feelings as a child (mainly because I would try to follow things up) and he would always get angry at me. I'm now a 29 year old adult, and he still claims to want to hang out from time to time. However I really don't believe him and get annoyed with this behavior because I know he won't follow through. Problem I have, is not that he won't hang out. If he doesn't value his family enough to spend time with them, that's fine. But he acts like everyone else is to blame for this (even though he suggests hanging out, and other people have to follow up to see if event is really taking place).",

I can't sleep with my door shut at night because I'm terrified someone or something is in my room, in my closet or hiding under my bed. I can't sleep if the door is unlocked, and I have empty soda bottles along my window sill to let me know if someone breaks in. I have to have a nightlight so I can see every corner of my room to be sure no one is there. I also do this thing, where I literally pretend to be someone else entirely.

I tried many different sports(triathlon, half-marathon, boxing) for building precision, watched 100-s of TED talks, took some courses in coursera but seems like it getting worse and worse. Friends and family call me lazy,moony etc. While studying i distract every 5-7 minutes. To enter this question i spend like 3 hours. But sometimes feel very energetic, enthusiastic for a couple minutes. I jump, shout and feel like a champion. And i cant really predict this or control. Especially when i listen to the music. I stopped drinking alcohol for 3 month and do not plan to continue.

During these 3 month i cried a lot, punched myself in a face, tried to die while doing sports. Time goes faster and my mental power is reducing. I forget things more often and sleep more. In the period from 8 to 16 years old my daddy used to punish me physically and was shouting at me probably everyday.

I fear there is more wrong with me and I have tried to tell my mum about what happens but she just kinda pushes it under the rug. I will explain now some of the things I feel\u2026 \u2013 I for some reason don't have a conscience, now, I don't particularly get the urge to hurt animals or people, but I don't really get sad when it happens. I don't feel anything when I do something wrong, I wonder why that is. It's like I can't feel guilty. It just doesn't exist. I started doing heroin to deal with things when I was seventeen. I've stolen from places and people and now sober I still don't care. \u2013 I often feel spacey, like I'm here but I'm not. I can listen to you and respond but It's not me because I often don't remember. And sometimes I will be in my room and when I come out of a trance I realize its been anywhere from hours and hours, to days. \u2013 Some lucky random days I' suddenly happy, like today so I'm writing about it before it ends. but other days I snap and I'm violent and angry, almost exclusively to myself. sometimes I cut myself really bad but I don't remember doing it when I come to. \u2013 Random bouts of anxiety where I can't even go into a gas station and pay for gas or cigarettes alone. That's like the worse of it and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this???",

She had to be 6 or 7 and I about 8 or 9. It went from combing my hair to rubbing my shoulders to us kissing. Eventually it lead to us touching. She would come over every now and then and we would experiment. I think eventually it led to oral by her suggestion because she would engage in the same activity with her mother's daughter's friend. I stopped once I got caught dry humping another girl who was around my age. My mom didn't scold me but had a sit down with myself and the other girl along with the other mom to say it was inappropriate. My cousin would still come over to spend the night and rub against my leg to make me join in sexual play but I would say no firmly and kick her hand or foot off me. I guess my guilt stems from me being older. I should have known better. And I feel absolutely terrible about it. It keeps me up all night sometimes. I don't remember her trying to force me other than the rubbing leg incident. And I don't remember me forcing her to do anything. When I think about it I think she was far more advanced mentally than I was. My aunts house did not have the same rules as mine. The kids watched whatever they wanted even R-rated movies as they always had televisions in their room. When I would go over their house they would always call me \u201cslow\u201d because I didn't get certain things. I guess being that I wasn't street smart like them and was sheltered (no tv in the rooms only age appropriate shows). Anyway these sexual play encounters have really plagued my with tremendous guilt recently. I don't want to think that I molested my younger cousin. I turned very mean to her to nip all attempts of sexual play in the bud. To make her hate me was a mechanism to keep us safe and appropriate I guess. She eventually came out as bisexual. I don't want to think that I did this to her.. Please please help me figure this one out. I've been struggling for years.",

I met her in September 2009 my senior year of High School, and spent time with her every day or every other day, for varying lengths of the day (sometimes a whole class -we had gym for the first half of that school year- and some 5 minute periods before and after the last class, sometimes only those 5 minute periods). We also saw each other at dances and such. And we became close friends, and I eventually considered her a best friend. And, as a matter of fact, had feelings for her beyond friends. We hung out together throughout my Senior year, though it became less in the second half the year (we no longer had gym the second half, though we still met before and after the last two classes of the day with our group of friends, and eventually that half of the year I went to her lunch period to spend time). I took this girl to prom (though nothing intimate occurred as we were not dating), was with her at 3 graduation parties (one being my own), and a few other event though not more than maybe 2. Once I graduated was when we steadily stopped seeing each other. I kept in touch on Facebook, and Texted what I thought at the time was quite a lot (I believe it was once a week or once every two weeks at least), but whenever I asked to hangout, they were always busy. I still considered her close and important friend for all that happened in that year I knew her, because we had gotten very close. This period after we stopped seeing one another at all is the Fall and Winter of 2010. I still tried to keep in touch via text, though today, I'm not sure whether those amounted too much more than \u201cCan you hangout?\u201d \u201cNot this week, sorry.\u201d \u201cOk.\u201d which I'm frightened may be true, though part of me also wants to say that while some of the texts were like that, many many others were me striking up conversations and asking how her day or week was.",

But as the years go by I've noticed that the same people I've helped out seem to either leave me in the dust or I get the feeling they weren't actually appreciative of me helping them out. Don't get me wrong, I get that I'm not gonna be the only important thing in their lives but it still really hurts me for them to just drop me off like that when considering the countless hours I've spent with them assisting them through their own dilemmas and stretching my olive branch as far as I possibly can. But even then sometimes they would outright ignore my advice or spit it back in my face, only for them to get hurt because they didn't listen to my advice and by the end of it they come back saying I was right only for them to do the same exact thing and continue their own vicious cycle and it pained me deeply to see them that way. I can even think of moments where one of them would leave me in the dark while vaguely communicating with me leading me to get frustrated and anxious over what in gods name they'd be doing only for them to be completely fine by the end of it. It's terrible. Plus, every time I've tried to get in contact with some of these people now they seem to blow me off as if I never said hello. As a result, I feel hurt, I don't always think about them but when I do it feels like a dagger in my heart. I feel like I maybe shouldn't have tried to assist them and maybe I wouldn't feel like the way I do now. This really shouldn't bother me as much as it should but this just leads me to feel like I've been used and thrown away and as a result I question my own worth or if I should even bother.

Want to watch TV?\u201d). I do not directly address this in disagreement but he can tell from my facial expression that I am not with this. So he gets extremely defensive. All I can say is that I am allowed to have thoughts and those thoughts can disagree. But he wants me to agree with him and I just do not. There is also a jealousy issue. I bought his kid a stuffed animal and my partner says \u201cit's a good thing that I didn't buy a stuffed animal like I was going to cause then we would have to see whose gift he likes more\u201d. On Christmas day, when kid opened up a guitar he received from his dad and couldn't put it down, his dad yells \u201cHe likes my gift the best. I win!\u201d. The incidents that I mentioned above were minor but there have been really big arguments that have ensued from either in which my partner's go to excuse for yelling and screaming is that he is the parent and I need to stay in my lane. Just to clarify, once me going out of my lane involved me getting a lint roller to remove cat hair from his son's pjs before he put it on. I had matching pjs and the plan was that me and his kid were going to wear the pjs and have a movie and popcorn night. His dad said that he couldn't wear the pjs because he needed to get the cat hair off first. He was in the middle of cooking so I went to do it. I was yelled at for trying to undermine his authority because he already said that his son was not to wear those pjs at all (that was not what he said). I honestly feel it was a ploy to ruin pajama night. I am noticing that part of the problem is that my partner doesn't want certain things getting back to the baby mama for fear she will use their kid as leverage and not allow him to see his son.

I started having panic attacks about eight months ago with varying frequency and intensity. I've never had some of the most common complaints, like feelings of choking or having a heart attack. Mostly I get very dizzy and spacey, along with a panicked feeling of course. It's sometimes hard to follow conversations or even keep my balance. I've also started having blurry vision (akin to nearsightedness) and sometimes cloudy vision. More recently I've been getting shaky too. It used to be a slight tremble at most, but now I occasionally have people ask me if I'm alright or comment that it's not that cold out because I look like I'm shivering. This doesn't necessarily happen during a panic attack either. Sometimes I'll be laying in bed trying sleep or driving to work when it happens. I know these things can be symptoms of panic and are common side effects of medications, but they don't seem to correlate with changes in dosage or starting/stopping a med. In addition, I'm just wondering (maybe even hoping) if it's not uncommon for people to have panic attacks as a result of other underlying issues. I'm going back to get blood tests done soon (my gp has been on me about it for months, but it's hard to find a day that I'm both off work and also feeling up to it). Last time I had them done everything was more or less normal, but that was over a year before all this started. I keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way, because like I said, I don't seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people. It's also concerning that my prescribed benzodiazepine stops the panic, but a lot of the other symptoms persist (like the blurry vision, dizziness, and extreme fatigue despite it being the smallest dose). Is this something that happens with any kind of frequency? In truth, I'm sort of hoping there's something else going on that is a little more\u2026 definitive, if that makes sense. Thanks.",

I don't really talk to myself, I talk to people I no longer know and people I wish to know. I engage in long conversations with them that may last for 1~3 hour/s. I talk and imagine their answers in my head and then reply. I've been okay with it but for the past year, it started to bother me because I realized I waste about 30% of my day on it. I low-key like it, because it gives me chances I was never given and probably will never be given. I imagine myself doing all the stuff I couldn't do. I started to feel really bad about it when I realized I don't fully move on from any single thing in my life (a past lover or something I failed in before) because of this. I basically never forget anything that happened to me because I keep repeating everything in my head and also make up scenarios that never happened. It's starting to get out of control because it makes me unable to focus, whenever I see a movie I keep pausing to talk for some time and then I go on with the movie and repeat, which ends up with me finishing a 2 hour movie in over 5 hours. I never felt bad about it but now I do because I came to know that's basically why I never move on. I repeatedly think about things that happened years ago. I've had OCD since I was in grade 5 (about 8 years ago), I never fully recovered from it, it comes and goes. I don't know if it might be related. I tried controlling myself and refusing any urges to talk to whoever I talk to but I always fail. Thing is, I fully understand I'm not talking to real human being and I'm merely pleasing myself by achieving stuff I couldn't in real life, so I don't think I'm crazy or something. I just need to know if it's serious, and I certainly need help on how to stop this because I need the time I waste on doing it. (From Egypt)",

I remember a particular night, waking and feeling barely aware, as if I'd been drugged, and unable to move. I actually don't know if this is, in fact, a memory or if it was a nightmare, but it was very realistic. I was in my room, in my bed, and every detail about the room is there. I distinctly remember seeing the hallway light and this man my mother was married to standing at the door. He comes into the room and forces oral sex on me. All I remember is gasping for air and being unable to move my arms. To this day, 18 years later, I'm not sure if this experience was just an awful nightmare or if it is a memory. During this time, I also began suffering from sleep apnea and have had trouble sleeping since then. My life has generally been stressful since those years for various reasons. For example, I learned last year that I have seizures in my sleep (in addition to the daytime ones that began 10 years ago). I've done pretty good at not letting myself feel like a victim, especially since I have confusion regarding the past. But I have always wondered if I was drugged and raped as a minor. And if this is why my life has been stressful, why I seem to lack self-confidence, why I developed epilepsy and sleep issues. I don't know how to feel about it. Should I try to unlock any buried memories? Should I just shrug and bury the whole thing, move forward and all that? Will any of this help me better address the stresses I have? How important is it to resolve this? I am being treated for both the apnea and the epilepsy.",

Recently, she was fired for reasons here undisclosed. Obviously this was a gigantic blow for both of us. Since then, she's developed a series of behaviors that have led to me wanting to seek help here. In a nutshell, she has always been a sensitive and highly empathic person and she claims that she's been given a new calling from a higher being. She spends her nights now looking across the street at one of our neighbors, like in a movie, and with a video game controller, she follows what he's doing. She says that she is watching over him and that she will make his life better like this since he seems lonely to her. On top of this, she's fasting; only eating fruits and nuts during a certain portion of the day. All of it seems super calculated and ritualized in great detail. I come from an extremely religious family so I've seen similar but never ever like this. And this doesn't correspond to any popular religion. I'll say that she has never exhibited behavior like this in all the time we've been together. I'm obviously extremely worried about her and on a selfish note, I miss her a lot because she doesn't seem to need or want me anymore. The other thing is that she seems totally lucid when I speak with her, but what she does seems not right of course. She has not yet lost her temper with me or lashed out at me though even when I try to get her to stop. And another thing is that she's extremely proud and distrustful of doctors so I'm afraid that if I try to get her to see one, she'll break up with me. I'm wondering if I could get advice on what to do? Is it okay to start a correspondence with a doctor behind her back and try things out to see if she gets better? For example, since I'm a cook and she used to love my cooking, I'm going try to at least get her to eat by making some of her favorites. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

These voices appear during the day and at night while laying down so they arent specific to a tired state.

Since my teen years I've fantasised about them: being in a relationship, conversing with them, being intimate (sexually) etc. When in a relationship with another female celebrity I became obsessed with her and still am, saving hundreds of pictures of her, watching all the interviews I could because I wanted to act, sound and look like her, eat, exercise and use the same beauty products as her if I could find that information. Whenever seeing pictures of them I feel a painful pit in my stomach. I would follow pages on instagram that followed them. After they broke up I stayed obsessed, less than initially but still, focusing more on whoever he's currently with/dating (he's with a regular girl now). I've tried to pursue his interests (e.g. art and watch the same TV shows) and also more recently tried to even use the same products and dress the same way he does if I can find that info (But I don't want to be a man). I'm seeing a clinical psych and she said she's unsure and to just avoid checking their social media (tried many times and even after over a month of abstaining from all social media it never worked). I've tried journaling, meditating, talking to friends and some things help a little but not much. I can barely differentiate what I like and what him/his girlfriends like. I can't concentrate for a few minutes without them popping in my head even when I don't want them to. Avoiding doesn't help and I don't want to, nor replace it by forcing myself in a relationship. I want to confront it so I never have the issue again.",

I do not suffer from any sort of depression, (when i searched for this question, most people had been suffering from depression or had thoughts of committing suicide which i have not yet) and i do not have any problems against the people that i think about killing it just that it makes me happy killing in my mind. I have not told anyone so far as they may laugh at me (which i would also do), i am not sure if this is something normal or if this is something i should worry about as it may lead on to much worse thing but currently i do not believe that i will complete or act out these thoughts as it is illegal and against my religion but who knows something might click and even that may not stop me. All I asking is should i tell anyone, or should i just leave it be and not act on it, and what actions should i take (also i have come to being fascinated by surgeries which involve needles and knives and also murders which involve a lot of blood and i have not played video games in a year due to exams creeping closer so i do not think that that is the problem).

Lately, he was a bit more anxious and he did drink alcohol again (not too much) and started smoking again. Nothing was too alarming until 3 days ago he received some messages, went outside for 1h and when he came back, he started talking to people that weren't there, yelling, than talking quietly, and it was like he was hallucinating. At one point he even changed his personality. At hospital they said that it was brief reactive psychosis (f23. 9) and gave him clozapine and risperidon, and some other medication that i don't know. Since then, he did sleep, but he still talks, quietly, but still does.What do you think how long is this going to last? When will he stop talking? And does these hallucinations indicate that he has schizophrenia? I am very worried, so please answer me. Thank you.",

One of the main problems is a constant urge and desire to have some sort of serious mental health disorder, and I mean disorders from Schizophrenia to Dissociative Identity Disorder, and I can understand how absolutely horrible that sounds. My mind never seems to drift away from over-analyzing any small part of my day that may be related to some sort of symptom of a disorder (such as overreacting to any thoughts that don't seem to be mine kind of thing). I have already researched different disorders out of curiosity and know about different symptoms, I don't believe I am a hypochondriac. I am currently seeing someone about a possible Anxiety Disorder and I believe I am showing some early symptoms of a Dissociative Disorder and some form of Psychosis, but I can't help but worry about NOT being diagnosed with a disorder. Most nights I have imagined myself in a mental hospital when I am older or developing some sort of alternate personalities, the idea of someone experiencing these fascinate me, one recent dream of mine I remember was the exact life of me living with DID but I can't remember it exactly. I have also been on edge more than normal, I have flinched a shuddered to noises constantly struggling to reassure myself if the noises were real, I have also experienced Depersonalisation for at least 2-3 years which has started to mix with Derealisation which has also kept me on edge. One thing I think would help with my obsession would be to actually hear the thoughts and experiences of someone with the Disorders I am paranoid about. I would like to hear an opinion to help calm these obsessive thoughts. (From England)",

They had been together for 10 years (since he was 20 and she 19), lived together for 2. She was the first and only girl he ever dated and was completely committed to raising a family with her. In November his wife started a new job, and in March this year she left him. He is completely devastated. When it happened, he cut off all relationships and we were not able to see or talk to him for a whole month. At that time he was still hoping that she would go back to him, and was waiting for her at their home. When it became clear that she wouldn't come back, he moved back home with the family. For 2 weeks, he would just lay in bed staring at the ceiling, and couldn't sleep at night. My mother and I stayed close to him and whenever he wanted to, we would talk and discuss what had happened with him. At least he started to go to work. He is a very introverted person, and he had invested so much in that relationship at the expense of other relationships in his life. He has very few friends and he is not really close to family members. It seemed that things got a bit better. He started going out at times, and he started sleeping again. It has been 3 months since, but he is not capable of moving on. He has shut down again, doesn't want to talk to us, doesn't go out, has no interest on anything. We are trying to convince him to see a psychologist, but he won't go. He feels that his life has no meaning any more and he feels like he is suffocating in this life.

In October 2009 my wife found out I was cheating with a co-worker. I did not feel comfortable telling her all of the details at first so I continued lying as I felt I was protecting her already fragile state. I have been a liar since I can remember and I don't know how to stop. I realize I personally make the decision to lie every time I do it, but that doesn't seem to get in the way when it comes down to making a decision whether or not to lie. We have severe financial problems and will more than likely lose our home. My wife has told me we won't be married after she graduates from nursing school but we haven't separated yet because we have 3 children together and she doesn't have an income. I have been getting payday loans to subsidize my income and have paid a significant amount towards those loans to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. So goes the lying. I get loans my wife doesn't know about to keep things normal and she always finds out I have been getting money somewhere and I end up telling her the truth. She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I've done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn't seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I've done. She has made comments in the past that she would \u201cstab me\u201d and she would \u201cget off\u201d if she were to kill me (because I cheated). I know what I did to her was terrible and I feel like a terrible person every day. I live in a manic world to keep myself from going off the deep end. I have been told I can't leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately. I told her about my fear and she got extremely angry, told me I was selfish and started crying because that statement meant I didn't care about what I put her through. The fact is, I didn't know how to help her. I let myself get in the way a lot since she found out and she wouldn't let me provide comfort when she was in pain. I have never, nor will I ever inflict harm on her, but I fear her statement are true and the mental anguish I have caused is the reason she cut herself some this past year and almost overdosed on drugs. I am writing this because I want to stop lying. I am writing this because I want to know how to get out of the situation I am in without a huge legal mess. I love my kids; I love to be around them.

Is this even possible? To help a 12-year old get through this and just diagnose him as being smart? My child is not dumb and knows how to play both myself and his father. Thank you!",

Since these fantasies involve very gory details, I am ashamed of them and don't have the courage to describe them to anyone because I am afraid what people might think of me. The thoughts come by themselves in waves about twice a month and each wave lasts for about 3-5 days. During these days they slightly interfere with my normal social function as I experience typical sickness behavior (lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, reduction in grooming, hard to concentrate). Even if I try to concentrate on a task I feel like I can't control my mind or how I generally feel during that time. I thought for a long time that I am the only person in the world having thoughts like that and there is no help for me but recently I thought I might try to search for answers. However, I could not find any information about this phenomenon. Can you please help me women tell me if there is any literature about this that could help me understand what is going on?

During the past three years (noticed it more recently) I've been irritable, feeling high and low. Irritable, in the sense that I lash out at my husband for no reason. I just suddenly get angry \u2014 when he hasn't done anything- and start shouting. After, I feel an immense sense of guilt and I will often break down in tears. Other times, I have these sorts of daydreams \u2014 but they feel more real than daydreams, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is I'll get an idea in my head and I'll get lost in it \u2014 it can range from anything, a recent example was the idea of being in a famous band. In reality, I couldn't do such a thing due to being so timid. In this sense I also overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because. When it doesn't happen the way I imagined, I'll become depressed and feel generally hopeless, useless. If it is of any use, my grandmother had Bipolar. I apologize if this was muddled, but I'm not sure whether I should refer to a doctor or not, or if what I am experiencing is related to Bipolar at all. Thank you for your time!

I have a history of being touched by older men when I was a child, but I don't think that could have anything to do with this. I have had a few crushes on boys a few years younger than me in the past and I've just always liked boys that are cute and younger looking but the age gap is bigger than ever before, and I am genuinely concerned it may get worse. please give me some sort of guidance.

We are very openminded and compatible sexually, though our sex life has been through some ups and downs as we have grown as people and experienced child birth and child rearing. The first few years of our relationship, we did some wild things sexually, such as public sex, group sex, voyeurism, etc. We both enjoyed ourselves and were equally involved and responsible for our actions. During and after the pregnancy and birth of our child, however, our sex life went through some drastic changes, and we found ourselves with some sexual issues to work through. One of these issues was my newfound disinterest in our old wild ways; motherhood had turned my viewpoint on it from fun to irresponsible. We have gotten over most of the awkwardness that made its way into our bed, but now we are presented with a somewhat \u201egray area\u2030 issue. Over the past year or so, my husband has been visiting sexual video chat sites and broadcasting himself in various sexual states, most of the time masturbating, in both public and private online communications. At first he did this secretly, until I found out in a very startling way; I investigated the website that kept appearing in our computer\u201as browser history on my phone at work, and was shocked to find a live public video feed of my husband fully aroused. After some obvious conflict over the discovery, we discussed it, and he told me that he missed having our \u201ewild sex life\u2030 and that this helps fulfill that need. He asked if I would participate, and I agreed in hopes of helping to satisfy his sexual mentality. We broadcast ourselves having sex online a few times, having up to 1000 people watch, which completely turned my husband on and completely turned me off. I decided I wasn\u201at going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself. Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him \u201efaithful\u2030 to me since I am no longer interested. (Something you should know about my husband; he is a popular musician and is often confronted with opportunities for sex at shows, but I am confident that he hasn\u201at cheated on me). It is obviously a disturbing experience to get up and find him doing this, and although he is not physically cheating, I still feel hurt and disrespected on these occasions. I basically want an outsider\u201as point of view on whether I should accept this as part of the man I fell in love with and married, reject it on the grounds of how I feel (although I have a hard time with the thought of leaving him over it), or if we should try to work out some sort of compromise. I would like to come up with some way where he can feel fulfilled and I can be a part of it, without making me uncomfortable, but haven't been able to (not asking you to figure out what that would be for me, just mentioning it). Thank you very much for your time and help with this issue.",

He would tell me I seemed fine and I would tell him that part of it was my generalized anxiety making me stay more quiet and overthink and overthink until I figured out non-awkward or offensive things to say (esp. in a text). When I would bring this up, he would basically tell me to try harder because when we first dated (and I was on Abilify, an antipsychotic that actually can help autistics), I didn't act so different. Also during the relationship, he told me that he laughed during gore scenes in movies and had obsessive urges to harm people, but drowned it out with stories he told himself and video games. Now that we are broken up and he treats the relationship as if it were my fault for it ending and makes me do all the work to get him to talk to me, we have parted ways completely, and too often I have urges to harm him, mainly to show him the pain he caused me and my cause other, and also because he is entering the military with confidential computer data access which scares me. I'm angry with myself for becoming like him, but he called me out of my mind once, and I had a psychiatrist that tried to convince me I was with practically no evidence. Granted I was histrionic in the relationship and easily anxious that he'd break up with me when we had a really intense text fight involving all caps. He also accused me more than once of cheating when I never once cheated. Never agreed to call me as my therapist suggested us do for my NVLD.

I talk to myself 100% of the time I'm alone, like I'm a different person. I don't have a split personality, but at one(more than one) point I tried forcing myself into having one.

A lot of these insecurities are gone now but my habits have gone too far, and it's driving me crazy. I don't see an end to it, and it's messing with my ordinary thoughts and the way I think them.

I identify as nonbinary even though I was born female, but I know this could be a consequence of BPD.My therapist doesn't know about my condition because she just keeps asking me only about my anxiety and everytime I try to tell her something of the above she seems to not be even listening to me. I'm writing this because recently something changed.I've always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it's been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can't tell what's real anymore.I have nightmares and most of the days I don't know if what I experience is real or not.I see the younger me as a weak, pathetic girl who knew nothing about anything but I don't even remember how she was or what she liked. There's this other part of me, though, called Chrissie. She's a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine \u2013 sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I'm high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID. I'm very unsure about the amnesia that should incurr though, because I happen to be co-present when she takes control, but she does what she wants and I later feel like someone else has controlled my body even though I know what happened.When I dissociate while I'm writing something I can't remember later what I was writing before, and I noticed I have very few memories of my life before my 14th birthday, but nothing more than this.",

I've always had a slight fear of having schizophrenia, as I've studied mental illness since it's been a very big part of my life. Recently, however, I feel those feelings have been slightly amplified due to the correlative nature between schizophrenia and marijuana usage displayed in medical and psychological studies. I've noticed myself becoming paranoid when under the influence (a common thing, I know). That paranoia usually subsides after I rest, along with the influence of the drug. That being said, I've been having some thoughts of being able to change the world. These thoughts occur heavily when I'm high, but also sometimes happen when I'm sober (only much less intense), and usually come in the form of being able to educate people about empathy and kindness (since I'm a teacher and an actor). I've also had moments where I try to empathize with people in order to understand what they're thinking, and maybe even try to \u201cread their thoughts\u201d in order to better connect with them. Do I truly believe I can? No. But I do think I can come close to identify how their feeling in order to better help them with their problems.

This is quite typical in our culture. As a child, I don't have any memory of negative experiences until the age of 8 or 9. We moved to another house, because of some differences between mom and grandmother. Unfortunately, I was sexually abused by two of my neighbors at this house. People my mother trusted. One a 15-year-old and the other in his late 20's. I was doing well at school in academics and athletics. Few years later, that started deteriorating too. I had some publicly humiliating experiences from some of my teachers too. It doesn't seem like a big deal to me now but to my teenage self it was pretty big. I also had inappropriate touching from strangers while out with friends and I always felt that I was somehow singled out by these characters. I literally felt I had a label on my forehead saying touch me. Thankfully I married to a wonderful man and I'm doing well career wise. Except for this aspect. Help!",

If they're in my face yelling about what I just said or how I forgot to do something, how can I not yell back? My parents say its disrespect, but I feel that they have no respect for me when they're yelling in my face. But the topic we argue most about is my little brother. He's 7 and if I do the slightest thing to him he goes and tells and I get the whole \u201cyou're older and need to grow up speech\u201d. I'm sick of it. I feel that they can't see that my little brother does things that really bother me, and I'm not being dramatic. Like today, my little brother does this thing where he just touches me. I HATE when he does this because it's COMPLETELY unnecessary. So I hit him back, not that hard just a slap in the arm. Just so happens my dad was walking by at the same exact time. When he saw this he immediately got in my face, hit my arm (and I had to fight back the urge to hit my dad right back), and started giving me a speech (which during I was completely being a smart aleck because I felt this whole thing was not my fault). When my mother got home I got the same speech from her, but she just didn't understand how I felt! Then while I was in the room right next to the kitchen they started to discuss what they should do to that \u201cdevil\u201d. But my defense is that my little brother is just very dumb and a wimp and that my parents baby him too much. But to avoid these confrontations I feel the only way to do this is to COMPLETELY IGNORE my whole family. I've been doing this by sleeping all day and my schoolwork is suffering, I also barely eat because of sleeping all day. But these arguments always seem to find their way into my life. Is there any way to get my parents to understand me? How do I deal with 7-year-old brother? Can I just keep ignoring them? Please do not treat his as a teenager being dramatic, this is a serious cry for help. After some of these arguments I've hurt myself. I scratched my arm with tweezers and today I dug my own nails into my arm. Some of these arguments have resulted in me almost getting smacked in the face by my dad. I've also cried for hours before.

Symptoms included hearing voices (inside my head, not outside), occasional visual hallucinations, self-injury and suicidal ideation. Each voice had a name and their own personality, and not all of the voices were negative. They interacted with each other and also with me. I was put on a high dose of risperidone and symptoms began to decrease, and I stopped seeing a psychiatrist. I am now 17 years old, and recently, I've been having inner dialogue going on between my own consciousness and two voices that are not created consciously by me. I am female and they are both male. One is the same age as me and one is around 19 or 20 and they both have their own names and personalities, similar to what I experienced when I was younger. Now, however, I'm noticing that I'm becoming more and more forgetful of what I've done and sometimes what I'm in the process of doing. For instance I've received classwork and exams handed back to me with my name on it that are written in different handwriting that I don't remember doing. My friends will ask me if I remember something we talked about yesterday or even earlier the same day and I won't recall what they're talking about. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of doing something and I suddenly forget what I was doing and have to ask my friend what I was just talking about. However, at times, one of the voices will say \u201cOh yeah I remember that!\u201d or they'll say \u201cwe were in the middle of doing this,\u201d most of the time being correct. I'm concerned and confused about what's been going on. I'm not sure if I'm having another psychotic episode and I'm delusional or if I might have signs of DID.

I was a little reluctant about the idea, but I did it anyway. Well I really REALLY wish I hadn't. Ever since then I've been afraid (I know it sounds ridiculous) I've been afraid of being possessed and hearing voices. There was no fear around this topic until they mentioned watching the movie, so I'm most likely sure that's how it started, although this is a fear I've had in the past, I don't recall it being this bad. This fear turned into not only the fear of being possessed, but the fear of hearing voices and becoming schizophrenic. It seems like no matter what family tells me I can never seem to believe that everything I'm afraid of are just thoughts. I want to learn how to not doubt that all of my anxiety is really JUST anxiety. It's been so scary to go to sleep at night, because I've been afraid of not waking up in the morning.

I was also seeing a psychiatrist for a mood disorder, and I was on an anti-psych medication that I stopped taking about a year ago. When I first started seeing the psychiatrist I told him I had began having powerful sexual urges that began a year before I started seeing him, but I never acted on them. I was also a huge germ-a-phobe. Why am I still thinking about the stripper and constantly turned on when I haven't seen her in over a month and is this related to my mood disorder?",

        "query": "Basically, I've come in search of help with anger management. I was raised with very strict, religious, over protective parents who constantly had violent arguments, taught me to shut down my emotions and to not express my feelings (at least not in healthy ways), taught me that the world is a dangerous, untrustworthy place, and that I cannot trust anyone. As a result, I have grown up to be very nervous, very shy, unable to trust others, unable to express love easily, unable to deal with negative thoughts or emotions in a productive fashion, afraid to be independent in the world, and constantly feel like I can't make something successful of myself. I wasn't always like this. I remember in my early childhood that I loved to socialize, explore the world, learn, I had dreams that I honestly thought I could reach. I was more positive, hopeful, and optimistic. Now, I feel as though all I ever feel is anger. I'm so restless. I want to do something, have fun, grow up , stop being so shy, and improve as a person, but, I don't know where to start. And with my parents not permitting me to go out on my own, or even express my feelings to them without them thinking I'm possessed or something, I feel trapped.I'm not a bad kid. I'm sure of that. I mess up here and there but I really try. Ask anyone. I've been obedient, respectful, polite, patient for as long as I can remember, but, lately, only with my parents, have I been lashing out at. Of course, not physically, but I have been getting more violent recently. I've gotten into the habit of breaking things around me when I'm angry and just screaming and crying. It's scaring me. I don't want to hurt anyone. My parents have done so much for me, and I know they have tried their best at raising me, but, I can't help but blame them for how I turned out and feel angry at them. Maybe it's my fault and I'm too ashamed to accept that so I take it out on them? I just need guidance. I need a plan, a place to start. I hate this feeling of cluelessness as it makes me feel breathless and trapped. Thank you for listening to his wacky 16 year old rant.",

I have a close relationship with both of my siblings, but I remember one night a while back I was sharing a bed with my little brother and I had the really strong urge to choke him for no reason. Had to turn away from him and just about scared myself shitless. Have had a few issues with depression, though nothing major. Nothing I can't deal with. I'm also fiercely independent, and have a very hard time admitting to weakness. Dont know if this helps, but past drug and alcohol addiction runs in the family on both sides, mostly dad's, though none of them are or ever have been addicts of any kind. I also know history of mental illness does too, on my mom's, and dads, no sure what, but probably along the lines of depression.

My sister never leaves the house and doesn't ever visit any friends, although there are people who care about her and often ask me how she is doing. Basically she's at home 24/7. She sleeps a lot and is sad often. She doesn't answer text messages from anybody, not friends or even family. I have spoken to her because I am concerned about her mental health, and she knows she is sick. She thinks that she has depression, as well as a disorder somewhere between social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder. But she just won't see a doctor. I have set up appointments for her only to fail in getting her to go- she just refuses and makes up an excuse like \u2018I'm feeling tired' or \u2018I'm busy'. The few times she has set up appointments have been the same- she just doesn't go. When she's physically sick she will go, but won't tell the doctor about her mental health because she feels embarrassed and awkward to tell a stranger about it. I can't afford to have a doctor come to her, and neither can my parents. Even my parents don't seem that concerned about her, they just complain that she has no job, even though that's the least of the problems and a mere symptom of her mental health issues. I just don't know what to do. It's also hard because she seems to be dependent on me as I'm the only social contact she really has. When I went away on holiday for a month, she complained to me that she missed me and I needed to come home. I want to be there for her but it is so draining to be the person that she depends on, especially because I'm not a doctor, and she is not receiving any therapy at all. When she comes on outings with me, I end up not enjoying myself because she gets very anxious and I feel that I need to mediate that all the time. I also suffer from social anxiety on a smaller level, and it's stressful to wonder what people might be thinking, if they notice her dependency and us both being anxious, and because of this, I prefer going alone.

A few years ago, I took a high paying job as a personal assistant. We were living in a bad neighborhood and I jumped at the opportunity to make more money- without questioning the logistics. It ended up being a personal assistant to a pimp, arranging dates, managing money, and sending out ads for the girls. We talked about what my job would entail, and he was not happy with it, but agreed that we needed the money and it wouldn't be forever. A few months after I started, my boss forced me to do something not in my job description. In the situation, I feared for my life, so I obliged. I didn't show up for my shift the next day, hoping it would all just go away and I could find a different job quickly. I started receiving threatening phone calls. My boss demanded all the money he had paid me back ($20,000). He had a copy of my ID and social from the hiring process. He made it very clear that my life was in his hands. I worked as a sex worker for a year and a half to pay him back in full. During that time, my boyfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out. Our marriage plans went out the window, I was forced out of our friend group, and was left to deal with the aftermath alone. That was two years ago, and we are in a much better place now. But for him, marriage still isn't on the table and his friends haven't welcomed me back. He says that he often blames himself for not figuring it out sooner, and blames me for not coming to him for help. I try to explain to him that I was scared to involve anyone else for fear of what would happen to them, but he just doesn't understand why I didn't go to the cops. I'm afraid this occurrence will always be a stain on my relationship resume with him, and that he will only see his pain of feeling betrayed and cheated on, when that was not my intention.

She never wants to touch, show affection, or be intimate with me anymore. She gets angry with me over things that were her her own decisions. I have read a lot on depression lately\u2026 the problem I am having is that she doesn't act this way with everyone. She never wants to just joke with me or have fun with me\u2026but she continues to joke and have fun with her other friends. I know that she feels safe with me and maybe feels like when its just us she can just be sad\u2026 but I am hurt. I just want to learn to accept this, that she needs to grieve and since she is closest with me she will allow her feelings to come out more readily. But I get so hurt by it.",

        "query": "For many years now my partner has insisted he needs to rest a lot. He rests for hours after coming home from work and spends all afternoon on the couch sleeping on the weekends. Yet he is not distressed by this and he doesn't ask his doctor to fully investigate this or continue going back saying I'm still tired. And when he's been offered referrals to suitable specialists refuses to go. Hence I'm wondering if this is a red flag in a relationship. In the past I've raised this issue asking him to get his fatigue fully investigated and to take up any referral offers advising of it's impact on our relationship (limited activities together, no kids as I felt he wouldn't cope with active kids plus being unfair on kids to be cooped up due to their father being too tired to be active with them) as well as saying it can't be very pleasant for you to feel like this and wouldn't it be better to feel less tired and have the energy to do things. I've also suggested sedentary activities but he's not interested. He also doesn't want to take any medication not even vitamins or trial antidepressants. It is hard on the partner as the partner starts off feeling sorry for the fatigued person and accommodates their need to rest to find several years down the track they've spent their life sitting on the couch rather than living life. And I'm thinking it's just not normal to have this excessive need for rest yet not be distressed by this. I could understand more if he had health problems that couldn't be treated but he tests as being very healthy and somehow has a high level of fitness. A bit of context \u2013 he does appear to have OCPD but many people with OCPD aren't chronically fatigued. I've extensively tried to get out on my own to build my own life and am now in the process of preparing to leave. I'd like to have the opinion of psych central as we hear a lot about red flags but I've not read much about this one which can be used as another way to control someone. (From Australia)",

I thought that being nice to her would gain her trust and we would get closer. But it seems to have the opposite reaction. The nicer I am, the more awkward, contradictory and demanding she becomes. She seems to need to push me until we have a disagreement. My partner's mother was English and her father Portuguese and she was brought up in Portugal. Her parents broke up when she was 10 and she ended up with her mother who did not spend much time with her as she had to work hard. With her job her mother was given a scholarship for her daughter to go to the local international school. My partner spent years there but never got on as her first language was not English. She felt very left out, not coming from a rich family. My partner has two older brothers and mentions her poor relationship with them when she was a child. They continually told her she was stupid and ugly. If she wore a new dress they would tease her mercilessly. I think this has had a big impact. (age 65, from United Kingdom)",

After that he went away in a trip and disappear for the whole trip without trying to reach me and also told me that his phone didn't have coverage there, that's why he didn't take it\u2026(another lie!) after all that I broke up with him\u2026I think he doesn't respect me because he is always adding girls on myspace and trying to meet girls\u2026we meet 5 months after we broke up and now he is asking me for a second chance\u2026we had sex once after the breakup, I think he only looks for me whenever he wants to have sex\u2026I still have feelings for him that's why I always end up accepting whatever he says but I know it is not good\u2026 What do I do? Should I give him a second chance or just forget about him? He says he is gonna make it up, that he has change an that now he is more mature but he had lied and hurt me so much that I feel that I love him but I have some anger towards him for making me cry so many times\u2026.why do I keep getting back with him every time he does something that hurts me? I Feel that I can get someone better, someone that would make me happy and don't hurt me that much\u2026but I don't know why I keep going back with him.",

First of all I don't feel like I think, or have the capacity to think like a normal person. I tend to get different ideas or incorrect information from what people are explaining to me, or it just takes me a long time to process the information that is given to me. This causes me to come off as stupid, or makes me seem that I don't care. Another thing is I take my transgressions toward others very seriously, when I feel like I've don't something wrong, or let someone down I really take it to heart because I don't want to be the cause of someone's disappointment. I feel this is the right thing to do, but I always feel like I've don't something wrong when I express this to my friends or co-workers. Growing up I always felt like I was an intelligent person. I never really thought like a child and was always more aware of myself and how my actions affected those around me than most other children. I love learning, but can't seem to understand what people are saying to me. I've always had this inner monologue that is either pushing me to do something I don't want to do, or just telling me negative things about myself. I've actually caught myself sometimes arguing out loud with this voice. It was me speaking the whole time, but in two different tones. Also I tend to see really horrible images in my head. For example if I see a plane flying by I'll see it blowing up right in front of my eyes. Or if I'm see a person walking down the street I'll see them getting hit by a car. I don't want these things to happen and it really upsets me when I see them to the point where I'll sometimes start crying. Right now I just had something happen at work that I feel terrible about and it affected everyone in the building. All I keep seeing is me running and jumping out the open window in the office before anyone could stop me. I wouldn't do it, but I keep feeling this way. These things cause many problems all of my relationships. Any Advice?",

However, I have always been someone that makes friends easily, I never have any issue with anyone and generally I would say I'm pleasant person. But for some reason some of his school friends were not welcoming to me. perhaps I was seen as an outsider, (I'm European), or as someone a bit different. but me and him are very happy together. Over the years I've heard from some of his friends that they had \u201cheard I was a horrible person and heard bad things about me from other people\u201d, and the people were always people I'd never met, and it was just girls or bitchy people that my bf went to school with. I never understood it, but it really did hurt my feelings because as I said before I'm an open-minded and friendly person, and don't think I've experienced people just randomly saying horrible things about me behind my back. we have a great friendship group with lots of his and my friends, and we all get on really well. however, I'm surprised and hurt that he would go to this event next weekend considering there will be people there that clearly have some strange vendetta against me that I can't explain, nor do I know where it stems from. he says it shouldn't matter to me, but it does.this is a big deal for me and I'm surprised he would walk over me like this. should I be hurt or just accept that he wants to go to this school reunion? he sees his friends all the time, so it's not really a \u201creunion\u201d. thank you (From the UK)",

I am so embarrassed because I frequently find myself fighting back tears in public. I'm not depressed, I am very happy in general, it's just that my emotional responses are childlike and it only takes the tiniest thing to set me off. I'm constantly struggling not to cry like a silly little girl, I can't seem to control myself. I can't really describe the things that upset me, because they are so varied.

I started to lose trust when finding a text message in his phone from someone calling him \u201cbabe\u201d on Valentines Day. He said it was nothing like that, and I asked to see the rest of the messages from that person but he said no because he thought that would change the dynamics of our relationship and that I am supposed to just trust him, so I let it go. Ever since that occasion it's been so hard for me to trust him like I did in the beginning. He's constantly texting some person in his phone and I'm 99% sure it is a female, which does not bother me. But what does bother me is that for some reason I have this gut instinct that this female he is constantly texting is someone he is involved with. When I sit and ponder on that idea I think to myself, \u201cHe doesn't even have time to spend with other women, he's always so busy.\u201d But I almost feel like I'm convincing myself because I just have this feeling inside.

Since then I have had difficulty with suicidal thoughts, depersonalization and derealization. Sometimes I feel like part of me is watching over me, and that it wants me to join it in heaven. Other times I get scared when I'm around loved ones because I know they are going to die one day, and that I'll be left without them. I also get scared that I'm going to die, that I could end my life without realizing I'm doing it. How I feel seems to vary by the day, but they are not mood swings from high to low, just low to lower. When I'm walking around sometimes I feel like I may be in heaven already, especially when I'm walking through scenic environments. If I see something especially pretty or out of place I feel like I may be imagining it. Even going to the lake is enough to make me wonder if I'm real. This feeling doesn't ever go away.
