Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87).
